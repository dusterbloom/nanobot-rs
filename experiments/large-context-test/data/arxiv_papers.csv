2602.13194v1,Semantic Chunking and the Entropy of Natural Language,Weishun Zhong; Doron Sivan; Tankut Can; Mikhail Katkov; Misha Tsodyks,"The entropy rate of printed English is famously estimated to be about one bit per character, a benchmark that modern large language models (LLMs) have only recently approached. This entropy rate implies that English contains nearly 80 percent redundancy relative to the five bits per character expected for random text. We introduce a statistical model that attempts to capture the intricate multi-scale structure of natural language, providing a first-principles account of this redundancy level. Our model describes a procedure of self-similarly segmenting text into semantically coherent chunks down to the single-word level. The semantic structure of the text can then be hierarchically decomposed, allowing for analytical treatment. Numerical experiments with modern LLMs and open datasets suggest that our model quantitatively captures the structure of real texts at different levels of the semantic hierarchy. The entropy rate predicted by our model agrees with the estimated entropy rate of printed English. Moreover, our theory further reveals that the entropy rate of natural language is not fixed but should increase systematically with the semantic complexity of corpora, which are captured by the only free parameter in our model.",2026-02-13,cs.CL; cond-mat.dis-nn; cond-mat.stat-mech; cs.AI
2602.13191v1,CoPE-VideoLM: Codec Primitives For Efficient Video Language Models,Sayan Deb Sarkar; Rémi Pautrat; Ondrej Miksik; Marc Pollefeys; Iro Armeni; Mahdi Rad; Mihai Dusmanu,"Video Language Models (VideoLMs) empower AI systems to understand temporal dynamics in videos. To fit to the maximum context window constraint, current methods use keyframe sampling which can miss both macro-level events and micro-level details due to the sparse temporal coverage. Furthermore, processing full images and their tokens for each frame incurs substantial computational overhead. To address these limitations, we propose to leverage video codec primitives (specifically motion vectors and residuals) which natively encode video redundancy and sparsity without requiring expensive full-image encoding for most frames. To this end, we introduce lightweight transformer-based encoders that aggregate codec primitives and align their representations with image encoder embeddings through a pre-training strategy that accelerates convergence during end-to-end fine-tuning. Our approach reduces the time-to-first-token by up to $86\%$ and token usage by up to $93\%$ compared to standard VideoLMs. Moreover, by varying the keyframe and codec primitive densities we are able to maintain or exceed performance on $14$ diverse video understanding benchmarks spanning general question answering, temporal reasoning, long-form understanding, and spatial scene understanding.",2026-02-13,cs.CV; cs.AI; cs.CL
2602.13151v1,Quantization-Robust LLM Unlearning via Low-Rank Adaptation,João Vitor Boer Abitante; Joana Meneguzzo Pasquali; Luan Fonseca Garcia; Ewerton de Oliveira; Thomas da Silva Paula; Rodrigo C. Barros; Lucas S. Kupssinskü,"Large Language Model (LLM) unlearning aims to remove targeted knowledge from a trained model, but practical deployments often require post-training quantization (PTQ) for efficient inference. However, aggressive low-bit PTQ can mask or erase unlearning updates, causing quantized models to revert to pre-unlearning behavior. We show that standard full-parameter fine-tuning often induce parameter changes that are too small to survive 4-bit quantization. We propose quantization-robust unlearning via low-rank adaptation (LoRA): we freeze the base model and concentrate unlearning into trainable adapters so that the effective update is preserved after quantization. On Llama-2-7B evaluated with MUSE dataset (BOOKS and NEWS), LoRA improves 4-bit utility by up to 7.93 points (NPO+GDR on BOOKS: 50.17 to 58.10) and yields higher 4-bit utility on NEWS for GA+GDR (40.06 to 44.82, increase of 4.76). LoRA also substantially reduces privacy leakage under 4-bit PTQ, e.g., for GA+KLR on BOOKS, PrivLeak moves from -25.68 to -5.86 (closer to ideal 0), while maintaining strong forgetting (VerMem and KnowMem near 0). Thus, using LoRA for Machine Unlearning is beneficial for scenarios where quantization is necessary for model deployment.",2026-02-13,cs.LG; cs.CL
2602.13139v1,OpenLID-v3: Improving the Precision of Closely Related Language Identification -- An Experience Report,Mariia Fedorova; Nikolay Arefyev; Maja Buljan; Jindřich Helcl; Stephan Oepen; Egil Rønningstad; Yves Scherrer,"Language identification (LID) is an essential step in building high-quality multilingual datasets from web data. Existing LID tools (such as OpenLID or GlotLID) often struggle to identify closely related languages and to distinguish valid natural language from noise, which contaminates language-specific subsets, especially for low-resource languages. In this work we extend the OpenLID classifier by adding more training data, merging problematic language variant clusters, and introducing a special label for marking noise. We call this extended system OpenLID-v3 and evaluate it against GlotLID on multiple benchmarks. During development, we focus on three groups of closely related languages (Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian; Romance varieties of Northern Italy and Southern France; and Scandinavian languages) and contribute new evaluation datasets where existing ones are inadequate. We find that ensemble approaches improve precision but also substantially reduce coverage for low-resource languages. OpenLID-v3 is available on https://huggingface.co/HPLT/OpenLID-v3.",2026-02-13,cs.CL
2602.13123v1,From sunblock to softblock: Analyzing the correlates of neology in published writing and on social media,Maria Ryskina; Matthew R. Gormley; Kyle Mahowald; David R. Mortensen; Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick; Vivek Kulkarni,"Living languages are shaped by a host of conflicting internal and external evolutionary pressures. While some of these pressures are universal across languages and cultures, others differ depending on the social and conversational context: language use in newspapers is subject to very different constraints than language use on social media. Prior distributional semantic work on English word emergence (neology) identified two factors correlated with creation of new words by analyzing a corpus consisting primarily of historical published texts (Ryskina et al., 2020, arXiv:2001.07740). Extending this methodology to contextual embeddings in addition to static ones and applying it to a new corpus of Twitter posts, we show that the same findings hold for both domains, though the topic popularity growth factor may contribute less to neology on Twitter than in published writing. We hypothesize that this difference can be explained by the two domains favouring different neologism formation mechanisms.",2026-02-13,cs.CL
2602.13110v1,SCOPE: Selective Conformal Optimized Pairwise LLM Judging,Sher Badshah; Ali Emami; Hassan Sajjad,"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as judges to replace costly human preference labels in pairwise evaluation. Despite their practicality, LLM judges remain prone to miscalibration and systematic biases. This paper proposes SCOPE (Selective Conformal Optimized Pairwise Evaluation), a framework for selective pairwise judging with finite-sample statistical guarantees. Under exchangeability, SCOPE calibrates an acceptance threshold such that the error rate among non-abstained judgments is at most a user-specified level $α$. To provide SCOPE with a bias-neutral uncertainty signal, we introduce Bidirectional Preference Entropy (BPE), which queries the judge under both response positions, aggregates the implied preference probabilities to enforce invariance to response order, and converts the aggregated probability into an entropy-based uncertainty score. Across MT-Bench, RewardBench, and Chatbot Arena, BPE improves uncertainty quality over standard confidence proxies, providing a stronger selection signal that enables SCOPE to consistently meet the target risk level while retaining good coverage across judge scales. In particular, at $α= 0.10$, \textsc{Scope} consistently satisfies the risk bound across all benchmarks and judge scales (empirical risk $\approx 0.097$ to $0.099$), while retaining substantial coverage, reaching $0.89$ on RewardBench with Qwen-14B and $0.98$ on RewardBench with Qwen-32B. Compared to naïve baselines, \textsc{Scope} accepts up to $2.4\times$ more judgments on MT-Bench with Qwen-7B under the same target risk constraint, demonstrating that BPE enables reliable and high-coverage LLM-based evaluation.",2026-02-13,cs.CL; cs.AI
2602.13102v1,Towards interpretable models for language proficiency assessment: Predicting the CEFR level of Estonian learner texts,Kais Allkivi,"Using NLP to analyze authentic learner language helps to build automated assessment and feedback tools. It also offers new and extensive insights into the development of second language production. However, there is a lack of research explicitly combining these aspects. This study aimed to classify Estonian proficiency examination writings (levels A2-C1), assuming that careful feature selection can lead to more explainable and generalizable machine learning models for language testing. Various linguistic properties of the training data were analyzed to identify relevant proficiency predictors associated with increasing complexity and correctness, rather than the writing task. Such lexical, morphological, surface, and error features were used to train classification models, which were compared to models that also allowed for other features. The pre-selected features yielded a similar test accuracy but reduced variation in the classification of different text types. The best classifiers achieved an accuracy of around 0.9. Additional evaluation on an earlier exam sample revealed that the writings have become more complex over a 7-10-year period, while accuracy still reached 0.8 with some feature sets. The results have been implemented in the writing evaluation module of an Estonian open-source language learning environment.",2026-02-13,cs.CL
2602.13093v1,Consistency of Large Reasoning Models Under Multi-Turn Attacks,Yubo Li; Ramayya Krishnan; Rema Padman,"Large reasoning models with reasoning capabilities achieve state-of-the-art performance on complex tasks, but their robustness under multi-turn adversarial pressure remains underexplored. We evaluate nine frontier reasoning models under adversarial attacks. Our findings reveal that reasoning confers meaningful but incomplete robustness: most reasoning models studied significantly outperform instruction-tuned baselines, yet all exhibit distinct vulnerability profiles, with misleading suggestions universally effective and social pressure showing model-specific efficacy. Through trajectory analysis, we identify five failure modes (Self-Doubt, Social Conformity, Suggestion Hijacking, Emotional Susceptibility, and Reasoning Fatigue) with the first two accounting for 50% of failures. We further demonstrate that Confidence-Aware Response Generation (CARG), effective for standard LLMs, fails for reasoning models due to overconfidence induced by extended reasoning traces; counterintuitively, random confidence embedding outperforms targeted extraction. Our results highlight that reasoning capabilities do not automatically confer adversarial robustness and that confidence-based defenses require fundamental redesign for reasoning models.",2026-02-13,cs.AI; cs.CL
2602.13084v1,Exploring a New Competency Modeling Process with Large Language Models,Silin Du; Manqing Xin; Raymond Jia Wang,"Competency modeling is widely used in human resource management to select, develop, and evaluate talent. However, traditional expert-driven approaches rely heavily on manual analysis of large volumes of interview transcripts, making them costly and prone to randomness, ambiguity, and limited reproducibility. This study proposes a new competency modeling process built on large language models (LLMs). Instead of merely automating isolated steps, we reconstruct the workflow by decomposing expert practices into structured computational components. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to extract behavioral and psychological descriptions from raw textual data and map them to predefined competency libraries through embedding-based similarity. We further introduce a learnable parameter that adaptively integrates different information sources, enabling the model to determine the relative importance of behavioral and psychological signals. To address the long-standing challenge of validation, we develop an offline evaluation procedure that allows systematic model selection without requiring additional large-scale data collection. Empirical results from a real-world implementation in a software outsourcing company demonstrate strong predictive validity, cross-library consistency, and structural robustness. Overall, our framework transforms competency modeling from a largely qualitative and expert-dependent practice into a transparent, data-driven, and evaluable analytical process.",2026-02-13,cs.CL
2602.13073v1,LCSB: Layer-Cyclic Selective Backpropagation for Memory-Efficient On-Device LLM Fine-Tuning,Juneyoung Park; Eunbeen Yoon; Seongwan Kim. Jaeho Lee,"Memory-efficient backpropagation (MeBP) has enabled first-order fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) on mobile devices with less than 1GB memory. However, MeBP requires backward computation through all transformer layers at every step, where weight decompression alone accounts for 32--42% of backward time. We propose Layer-Cyclic Selective Backpropagation (LCSB), which computes gradients for only a subset of layers per step. Our key insight is that residual connections guarantee gradient flow through identity paths, while AdamW momentum provides implicit updates for non-selected layers. We interpret LCSB as Block Coordinate Descent on the LoRA parameter space, providing theoretical justification for convergence. LCSB achieves up to 1.40$\times$ speedup with less than 2\% quality degradation across five models and three tasks. Surprisingly, in 4-bit quantized settings, LCSB exhibits superior stability: a 3B model that completely diverges under full backpropagation converges smoothly with LCSB, suggesting an implicit regularization effect from selective gradient computation.",2026-02-13,cs.LG; cs.CL
2602.13069v1,Memory-Efficient Structured Backpropagation for On-Device LLM Fine-Tuning,Juneyoung Park; Yuri Hong; Seongwan Kim; Jaeho Lee,"On-device fine-tuning enables privacy-preserving personalization of large language models, but mobile devices impose severe memory constraints, typically 6--12GB shared across all workloads. Existing approaches force a trade-off between exact gradients with high memory (MeBP) and low memory with noisy estimates (MeZO). We propose Memory-efficient Structured Backpropagation (MeSP), which bridges this gap by manually deriving backward passes that exploit LoRA's low-rank structure. Our key insight is that the intermediate projection $h = xA$ can be recomputed during backward at minimal cost since rank $r \ll d_{in}$, eliminating the need to store it. MeSP achieves 49\% average memory reduction compared to MeBP on Qwen2.5 models (0.5B--3B) while computing mathematically identical gradients. Our analysis also reveals that MeZO's gradient estimates show near-zero correlation with true gradients (cosine similarity $\approx$0.001), explaining its slow convergence. MeSP reduces peak memory from 361MB to 136MB for Qwen2.5-0.5B, enabling fine-tuning scenarios previously infeasible on memory-constrained devices.",2026-02-13,cs.LG; cs.CL
2602.13059v1,TraceBack: Multi-Agent Decomposition for Fine-Grained Table Attribution,Tejas Anvekar; Junha Park; Rajat Jha; Devanshu Gupta; Poojah Ganesan; Puneeth Mathur; Vivek Gupta,"Question answering (QA) over structured tables requires not only accurate answers but also transparency about which cells support them. Existing table QA systems rarely provide fine-grained attribution, so even correct answers often lack verifiable grounding, limiting trust in high-stakes settings. We address this with TraceBack, a modular multi-agent framework for scalable, cell-level attribution in single-table QA. TraceBack prunes tables to relevant rows and columns, decomposes questions into semantically coherent sub-questions, and aligns each answer span with its supporting cells, capturing both explicit and implicit evidence used in intermediate reasoning steps. To enable systematic evaluation, we release CITEBench, a benchmark with phrase-to-cell annotations drawn from ToTTo, FetaQA, and AITQA. We further propose FairScore, a reference-less metric that compares atomic facts derived from predicted cells and answers to estimate attribution precision and recall without human cell labels. Experiments show that TraceBack substantially outperforms strong baselines across datasets and granularities, while FairScore closely tracks human judgments and preserves relative method rankings, supporting interpretable and scalable evaluation of table-based QA.",2026-02-13,cs.CL
2602.13047v1,Can we trust AI to detect healthy multilingual English speakers among the cognitively impaired cohort in the UK? An investigation using real-world conversational speech,Madhurananda Pahar; Caitlin Illingworth; Dorota Braun; Bahman Mirheidari; Lise Sproson; Daniel Blackburn; Heidi Christensen,"Conversational speech often reveals early signs of cognitive decline, such as dementia and MCI. In the UK, one in four people belongs to an ethnic minority, and dementia prevalence is expected to rise most rapidly among Black and Asian communities. This study examines the trustworthiness of AI models, specifically the presence of bias, in detecting healthy multilingual English speakers among the cognitively impaired cohort, to make these tools clinically beneficial. For experiments, monolingual participants were recruited nationally (UK), and multilingual speakers were enrolled from four community centres in Sheffield and Bradford. In addition to a non-native English accent, multilinguals spoke Somali, Chinese, or South Asian languages, who were further divided into two Yorkshire accents (West and South) to challenge the efficiency of the AI tools thoroughly. Although ASR systems showed no significant bias across groups, classification and regression models using acoustic and linguistic features exhibited bias against multilingual speakers, particularly in memory, fluency, and reading tasks. This bias was more pronounced when models were trained on the publicly available DementiaBank dataset. Moreover, multilinguals were more likely to be misclassified as having cognitive decline. This study is the first of its kind to discover that, despite their strong overall performance, current AI models show bias against multilingual individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds in the UK, and they are also more likely to misclassify speakers with a certain accent (South Yorkshire) as living with a more severe cognitive decline. In this pilot study, we conclude that the existing AI tools are therefore not yet reliable for diagnostic use in these populations, and we aim to address this in future work by developing more generalisable, bias-mitigated models.",2026-02-13,cs.CL; cs.AI
2602.13035v1,Look Inward to Explore Outward: Learning Temperature Policy from LLM Internal States via Hierarchical RL,Yixiao Zhou; Yang Li; Dongzhou Cheng; Hehe Fan; Yu Cheng,"Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) trains large language models (LLMs) from sampled trajectories, making decoding strategy a core component of learning rather than a purely inference-time choice. Sampling temperature directly controls the exploration--exploitation trade-off by modulating policy entropy, yet existing methods rely on static values or heuristic adaptations that are decoupled from task-level rewards. We propose Introspective LLM, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that learns to control sampling temperature during generation. At each decoding step, the model selects a temperature based on its hidden state and samples the next token from the resulting distribution. Temperature and token policies are jointly optimized from downstream rewards using a coordinate ascent scheme. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that learned temperature policies outperform fixed and heuristic baselines, while exhibiting interpretable exploration behaviors aligned with reasoning uncertainty.",2026-02-13,cs.LG; cs.AI; cs.CL
2602.13033v1,Buy versus Build an LLM: A Decision Framework for Governments,Jiahao Lu; Ziwei Xu; William Tjhi; Junnan Li; Antoine Bosselut; Pang Wei Koh; Mohan Kankanhalli,"Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a new frontier of digital infrastructure that can support a wide range of public-sector applications, from general purpose citizen services to specialized and sensitive state functions. When expanding AI access, governments face a set of strategic choices over whether to buy existing services, build domestic capabilities, or adopt hybrid approaches across different domains and use cases. These are critical decisions especially when leading model providers are often foreign corporations, and LLM outputs are increasingly treated as trusted inputs to public decision-making and public discourse. In practice, these decisions are not intended to mandate a single approach across all domains; instead, national AI strategies are typically pluralistic, with sovereign, commercial and open-source models coexisting to serve different purposes. Governments may rely on commercial models for non-sensitive or commodity tasks, while pursuing greater control for critical, high-risk or strategically important applications.   This paper provides a strategic framework for making this decision by evaluating these options across dimensions including sovereignty, safety, cost, resource capability, cultural fit, and sustainability. Importantly, ""building"" does not imply that governments must act alone: domestic capabilities may be developed through public research institutions, universities, state-owned enterprises, joint ventures, or broader national ecosystems. By detailing the technical requirements and practical challenges of each pathway, this work aims to serve as a reference for policy-makers to determine whether a buy or build approach best aligns with their specific national needs and societal goals.",2026-02-13,cs.CY; cs.AI; cs.CE; cs.CL; cs.SI

Ahmed; Li Li; Jiayi Zhang; Koustava Goswami; Subhojyoti Mukherjee; Branislav Kveton; Puneet Mathur; Franck Dernoncourt; Yue Zhao; Yu Wang; Ryan A. Rossi; Zhengzhong Tu; Hongru Du,"Evaluating image editing models remains challenging due to the coarse granularity and limited interpretability of traditional metrics, which often fail to capture aspects important to human perception and intent. Such metrics frequently reward visually plausible outputs while overlooking controllability, edit localization, and faithfulness to user instructions. In this work, we introduce a fine-grained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-as-a-Judge framework for image editing that decomposes common evaluation notions into twelve fine-grained interpretable factors spanning image preservation, edit quality, and instruction fidelity. Building on this formulation, we present a new human-validated benchmark that integrates human judgments, MLLM-based evaluations, model outputs, and traditional metrics across diverse image editing tasks. Through extensive human studies, we show that the proposed MLLM judges align closely with human evaluations at a fine granularity, supporting their use as reliable and scalable evaluators. We further demonstrate that traditional image editing metrics are often poor proxies for these factors, failing to distinguish over-edited or semantically imprecise outputs, whereas our judges provide more intuitive and informative assessments in both offline and online settings. Together, this work introduces a benchmark, a principled factorization, and empirical evidence positioning fine-grained MLLM judges as a practical foundation for studying, comparing, and improving image editing approaches.",2026-02-13,cs.CV; cs.CL
2602.12996v1,"Know More, Know Clearer: A Meta-Cognitive Framework for Knowledge Augmentation in Large Language Models",Hao Chen; Ye He; Yuchun Fan; Yukun Yan; Zhenghao Liu; Qingfu Zhu; Maosong Sun; Wanxiang Che,"Knowledge augmentation has significantly enhanced the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing methods typically operate on the simplistic premise that model performance equates with internal knowledge, overlooking the knowledge-confidence gaps that lead to overconfident errors or uncertain truths. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel meta-cognitive framework for reliable knowledge augmentation via differentiated intervention and alignment. Our approach leverages internal cognitive signals to partition the knowledge space into mastered, confused, and missing regions, guiding targeted knowledge expansion. Furthermore, we introduce a cognitive consistency mechanism to synchronize subjective certainty with objective accuracy, ensuring calibrated knowledge boundaries. Extensive experiments demonstrate the our framework consistently outperforms strong baselines, validating its rationality in not only enhancing knowledge capabilities but also fostering cognitive behaviors that better distinguish knowns from unknowns.",2026-02-13,cs.CL; cs.AI
2602.12989v1,Evaluating the Homogeneity of Keyphrase Prediction Models,Maël Houbre; Florian Boudin; Beatrice Daille,"Keyphrases which are useful in several NLP and IR applications are either extracted from text or predicted by generative models. Contrarily to keyphrase extraction approaches, keyphrase generation models can predict keyphrases that do not appear in a document's text called `absent keyphrases`. This ability means that keyphrase generation models can associate a document to a notion that is not explicitly mentioned in its text. Intuitively, this suggests that for two documents treating the same subjects, a keyphrase generation model is more likely to be homogeneous in their indexing i.e. predict the same keyphrase for both documents, regardless of those keyphrases appearing in their respective text or not; something a keyphrase extraction model would fail to do. Yet, homogeneity of keyphrase prediction models is not covered by current benchmarks. In this work, we introduce a method to evaluate the homogeneity of keyphrase prediction models and study if absent keyphrase generation capabilities actually help the model to be more homogeneous. To our surprise, we show that keyphrase extraction methods are competitive with generative models, and that the ability to generate absent keyphrases can actually have a negative impact on homogeneity. Our data, code and prompts are available on huggingface and github.",2026-02-13,cs.CL
2602.12984v1,SciAgentGym: Benchmarking Multi-Step Scientific Tool-use in LLM Agents,Yujiong Shen; Yajie Yang; Zhiheng Xi; Binze Hu; Huayu Sha; Jiazheng Zhang; Qiyuan Peng; Junlin Shang; Jixuan Huang; Yutao Fan; Jingqi Tong; Shihan Dou; Ming Zhang; Lei Bai; Zhenfei Yin; Tao Gui; Xingjun Ma; Qi Zhang; Xuanjing Huang; Yu-Gang Jiang,"Scientific reasoning inherently demands integrating sophisticated toolkits to navigate domain-specific knowledge. Yet, current benchmarks largely overlook agents' ability to orchestrate tools for such rigorous workflows. To bridge this gap, we introduce SciAgentGym, a scalable interactive environment featuring 1,780 domain-specific tools across four natural science disciplines, supported by a robust execution infrastructure. Complementing this, we present SciAgentBench, a tiered evaluation suite designed to stress-test agentic capabilities from elementary actions to long-horizon workflows. Our evaluation identifies a critical bottleneck: state-of-the-art models struggle with complex scientific tool-use. Even for a leading model like GPT-5, success rates drop sharply from 60.6% to 30.9% as interaction horizons extend, primarily due to failures in multi-step workflow execution. To address this, we propose SciForge, a data synthesis method that models the tool action space as a dependency graph to generate logic-aware training trajectories. By fine-tuning on these trajectories, our SciAgent-8B outperforms the significantly larger Qwen3-VL-235B-Instruct while exhibiting positive cross-domain transfer of scientific tool-use capabilities.

2602.12968v1,RGAlign-Rec: Ranking-Guided Alignment for Latent Query Reasoning in Recommendation Systems,Junhua Liu; Yang Jihao; Cheng Chang; Kunrong LI; Bin Fu; Kwan Hui Lim,"Proactive intent prediction is a critical capability in modern e-commerce chatbots, enabling ""zero-query"" recommendations by anticipating user needs from behavioral and contextual signals. However, existing industrial systems face two fundamental challenges: (1) the semantic gap between discrete user features and the semantic intents within the chatbot's Knowledge Base, and (2) the objective misalignment between general-purpose LLM outputs and task-specific ranking utilities. To address these issues, we propose RGAlign-Rec, a closed-loop alignment framework that integrates an LLM-based semantic reasoner with a Query-Enhanced (QE) ranking model. We also introduce Ranking-Guided Alignment (RGA), a multi-stage training paradigm that utilizes downstream ranking signals as feedback to refine the LLM's latent reasoning. Extensive experiments on a large-scale industrial dataset from Shopee demonstrate that RGAlign-Rec achieves a 0.12% gain in GAUC, leading to a significant 3.52% relative reduction in error rate, and a 0.56% improvement in Recall@3. Online A/B testing further validates the cumulative effectiveness of our framework: the Query-Enhanced model (QE-Rec) initially yields a 0.98% improvement in CTR, while the subsequent Ranking-Guided Alignment stage contributes an additional 0.13% gain. These results indicate that ranking-aware alignment effectively synchronizes semantic reasoning with ranking objectives, significantly enhancing both prediction accuracy and service quality in real-world proactive recommendation systems.",2026-02-13,cs.IR; cs.AI; cs.CL

While automated probing has been enabled by dynamic test generation, existing approaches often discover isolated failure cases, lack principled control over exploration, and provide limited insight into the underlying structure of model weaknesses. We propose ProbeLLM, a benchmark-agnostic automated probing framework that elevates weakness discovery from individual failures to structured failure modes. ProbeLLM formulates probing as a hierarchical Monte Carlo Tree Search, explicitly allocating limited probing budgets between global exploration of new failure regions and local refinement of recurring error patterns. By restricting probing to verifiable test cases and leveraging tool-augmented generation and verification, ProbeLLM grounds failure discovery in reliable evidence. Discovered failures are further consolidated into interpretable failure modes via failure-aware embeddings and boundary-aware induction. Across diverse benchmarks and LLMs, ProbeLLM reveals substantially broader, cleaner, and more fine-grained failure landscapes than static benchmarks and prior automated methods, supporting a shift from case-centric evaluation toward principled weakness discovery.",2026-02-13,cs.CL; cs.SE

To address this, we introduce a new idiom dataset, a large-scale, culturally-grounded corpus of 10,361 Bengali idioms. Each idiom is annotated under a comprehensive 19-field schema, established and refined through a deliberative expert consensus process, that captures its semantic, syntactic, cultural, and religious dimensions, providing a rich, structured resource for computational linguistics. To establish a robust benchmark for Bangla figurative language understanding, we evaluate 30 state-of-the-art multilingual and instruction-tuned LLMs on the task of inferring figurative meaning. Our results reveal a critical performance gap, with no model surpassing 50% accuracy, a stark contrast to significantly higher human performance (83.4%). This underscores the limitations of existing models in cross-linguistic and cultural reasoning. By releasing the new idiom dataset and benchmark, we provide foundational infrastructure for advancing figurative language understanding and cultural grounding in LLMs for Bengali and other low-resource languages.",2026-02-13,cs.CL

Le,"Code-switching (CS), which is when Vietnamese speech uses English words like drug names or procedures, is a common phenomenon in Vietnamese medical communication. This creates challenges for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, especially in low-resource languages like Vietnamese. Current most ASR systems struggle to recognize correctly English medical terms within Vietnamese sentences, and no benchmark addresses this challenge. In this paper, we construct a 34-hour \textbf{Vi}etnamese \textbf{Med}ical \textbf{C}ode-\textbf{S}witching \textbf{S}peech dataset (ViMedCSS) containing 16,576 utterances. Each utterance includes at least one English medical term drawn from a curated bilingual lexicon covering five medical topics. Using this dataset, we evaluate several state-of-the-art ASR models and examine different specific fine-tuning strategies for improving medical term recognition to investigate the best approach to solve in the dataset. Experimental results show that Vietnamese-optimized models perform better on general segments, while multilingual pretraining helps capture English insertions. The combination of both approaches yields the best balance between overall and code-switched accuracy. This work provides the first benchmark for Vietnamese medical code-switching and offers insights into effective domain adaptation for low-resource, multilingual ASR systems.",2026-02-13,cs.CL
2602.12892v1,RADAR: Revealing Asymmetric Development of Abilities in MLLM Pre-training,Yunshuang Nie; Bingqian Lin; Minzhe Niu; Kun Xiang; Jianhua Han; Guowei Huang; Xingyue Quan; Hang Xu; Bokui Chen; Xiaodan Liang,"Pre-trained Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) provide a knowledge-rich foundation for post-training by leveraging their inherent perception and reasoning capabilities to solve complex tasks. However, the lack of an efficient evaluation framework impedes the diagnosis of their performance bottlenecks. Current evaluation primarily relies on testing after supervised fine-tuning, which introduces laborious additional training and autoregressive decoding costs. Meanwhile, common pre-training metrics cannot quantify a model's perception and reasoning abilities in a disentangled manner. Furthermore, existing evaluation benchmarks are typically limited in scale or misaligned with pre-training objectives. Thus, we propose RADAR, an efficient ability-centric evaluation framework for Revealing Asymmetric Development of Abilities in MLLM pRe-training. RADAR involves two key components: (1) Soft Discrimination Score, a novel metric for robustly tracking ability development without fine-tuning, based on quantifying nuanced gradations of the model preference for the correct answer over distractors; and (2) Multi-Modal Mixture Benchmark, a new 15K+ sample benchmark for comprehensively evaluating pre-trained MLLMs' perception and reasoning abilities in a 0-shot manner, where we unify authoritative benchmark datasets and carefully collect new datasets, extending the evaluation scope and addressing the critical gaps in current benchmarks. With RADAR, we comprehensively reveal the asymmetric development of perceptual and reasoning capabilities in pretrained MLLMs across diverse factors, including data volume, model size, and pretraining strategy. Our RADAR underscores the need for a decomposed perspective on pre-training ability bottlenecks, informing targeted interventions to advance MLLMs efficiently.

2602.12889v1,BaziQA-Benchmark: Evaluating Symbolic and Temporally Compositional Reasoning in Large Language Models,Jiangxi Chen; Qian Liu,"We present BaziQA-Benchmark, a standardized benchmark for evaluating symbolic and temporally compositional reasoning in large language models. The benchmark is derived from 200 professionally curated, multiple-choice problems from the Global Fortune-teller Competition (2021--2025), where each instance requires structured inference over a fixed symbolic chart and interacting temporal conditions. Unlike anecdotal or prompt-driven evaluations, BaziQA-Benchmark enables objective scoring and controlled comparison across years, domains, and model families. We evaluate contemporary language models under a multi-turn setting and analyze performance variation across temporal difficulty, reasoning domains, and inference protocols.To further probe reasoning behavior, we introduce a lightweight Structured Reasoning Protocol that constrains inference order without adding domain knowledge. Results show that models consistently outperform chance but remain far from saturation, exhibiting pronounced sensitivity to temporal composition and reasoning order, as well as systematic failures on precise temporal localization and multi-condition symbolic judgments.",2026-02-13,cs.CL

Most existing approaches rely on supervised classification, genre labels, or coarse document-level representations, limiting their ability to uncover latent semantic structure. We present a graph-based framework for unsupervised discovery and evaluation of semantic communities in K-pop lyrics using line-level semantic representations. By constructing a similarity graph over lyric texts and applying community detection, we uncover stable micro-theme communities without genre, artist, or language supervision. We further identify boundary-spanning songs via graph-theoretic bridge metrics and analyse their structural properties. Across multiple robustness settings, boundary-spanning lyrics exhibit higher lexical diversity and lower repetition compared to core community members, challenging the assumption that hook intensity or repetition drives cross-theme connectivity. Our framework is language-agnostic and applicable to unlabeled cultural text corpora.",2026-02-13,cs.SI; cs.CL

Existing mental health benchmarks largely rely on social media data, limiting their ability to assess DSM-grounded diagnostic judgments. At the core of MentalBench is MentalKG, a psychiatrist-built and validated knowledge graph encoding DSM-5 diagnostic criteria and differential diagnostic rules for 23 psychiatric disorders. Using MentalKG as a golden-standard logical backbone, we generate 24,750 synthetic clinical cases that systematically vary in information completeness and diagnostic complexity, enabling low-noise and interpretable evaluation. Our experiments show that while state-of-the-art LLMs perform well on structured queries probing DSM-5 knowledge, they struggle to calibrate confidence in diagnostic decision-making when distinguishing between clinically overlapping disorders. These findings reveal evaluation gaps not captured by existing benchmarks.",2026-02-13,cs.CL
2602.12818v1,AIWizards at MULTIPRIDE: A Hierarchical Approach to Slur Reclamation Detection,Luca Tedeschini; Matteo Fasulo,"Detecting reclaimed slurs represents a fundamental challenge for hate speech detection systems, as the same lexcal items can function either as abusive expressions or as in-group affirmations depending on social identity and context. In this work, we address Subtask B of the MultiPRIDE shared task at EVALITA 2026 by proposing a hierarchical approach to modeling the slur reclamation process. Our core assumption is that members of the LGBTQ+ community are more likely, on average, to employ certain slurs in a eclamatory manner. Based on this hypothesis, we decompose the task into two stages. First, using a weakly supervised LLM-based annotation, we assign fuzzy labels to users indicating the likelihood of belonging to the LGBTQ+ community, inferred from the tweet and the user bio. These soft labels are then used to train a BERT-like model to predict community membership, encouraging the model to learn latent representations associated with LGBTQ+ identity. In the second stage, we integrate this latent space with a newly initialized model for the downstream slur reclamation detection task. The intuition is that the first model encodes user-oriented sociolinguistic signals, which are then fused with representations learned by a model pretrained for hate speech detection. Experimental results on Italian and Spanish show that our approach achieves performance statistically comparable to a strong BERT-based baseline, while providing a modular and extensible framework for incorporating sociolinguistic context into hate speech modeling. We argue that more fine-grained hierarchical modeling of user identity and discourse context may further improve the detection of reclaimed language.

2602.12811v1,Left-right asymmetry in predicting brain activity from LLMs' representations emerges with their formal linguistic competence,Laurent Bonnasse-Gahot; Christophe Pallier,"When humans and large language models (LLMs) process the same text, activations in the LLMs correlate with brain activity measured, e.g., with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Moreover, it has been shown that, as the training of an LLM progresses, the performance in predicting brain activity from its internal activations improves more in the left hemisphere than in the right one. The aim of the present work is to understand which kind of competence acquired by the LLMs underlies the emergence of this left-right asymmetry. Using the OLMo-2 7B language model at various training checkpoints and fMRI data from English participants, we compare the evolution of the left-right asymmetry in brain scores alongside performance on several benchmarks. We observe that the asymmetry co-emerges with the formal linguistic abilities of the LLM. These abilities are demonstrated in two ways: by the model's capacity to assign a higher probability to an acceptable sentence than to a grammatically unacceptable one within a minimal contrasting pair, or its ability to produce well-formed text. On the opposite, the left-right asymmetry does not correlate with the performance on arithmetic or Dyck language tasks; nor with text-based tasks involving world knowledge and reasoning. We generalize these results to another family of LLMs (Pythia) and another language, namely French. Our observations indicate that the left-right asymmetry in brain predictivity matches the progress in formal linguistic competence (knowledge of linguistic patterns).",2026-02-13,cs.CL; cs.AI; q-bio.NC
2602.12806v1,RAT-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Text Anonymization,Nataša Krčo; Zexi Yao; Matthieu Meeus; Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye,"Data containing personal information is increasingly used to train, fine-tune, or query Large Language Models (LLMs). Text is typically scrubbed of identifying information prior to use, often with tools such as Microsoft's Presidio or Anthropic's PII purifier. These tools have traditionally been evaluated on their ability to remove specific identifiers (e.g., names), yet their effectiveness at preventing re-identification remains unclear. We introduce RAT-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for text anonymization tools based on re-identification risk. Using U.S. demographic statistics, we generate synthetic text containing various direct and indirect identifiers across domains, languages, and difficulty levels. We evaluate a range of NER- and LLM-based text anonymization tools and, based on the attributes an LLM-based attacker is able to correctly infer from the anonymized text, we report the risk of re-identification in the U.S. population, while properly accounting for the disparate impact of identifiers. We find that, while capabilities vary widely, even the best tools are far from perfect in particular when direct identifiers are not written in standard ways and when indirect identifiers enable re-identification. Overall we find LLM-based anonymizers, including new iterative anonymizers, to provide a better privacy-utility trade-off albeit at a higher computational cost. Importantly, we also find them to work well across languages. We conclude with recommendations for future anonymization tools and will release the benchmark and encourage community efforts to expand it, in particular to other geographies.",2026-02-13,cs.CL; cs.AI; cs.CR; cs.LG

We propose a hybrid BERT-based model with Top-K routing and auxiliary losses to mitigate routing collapse and improve efficiency. The pipeline includes: (1) overall sentiment classification using BERT on 9,558 labeled reviews, (2) multi-label aspect extraction for six tourism-related aspects (host, price, location, amenities, cleanliness, connectivity), and (3) integrated ABSA with dynamic routing. The dataset consists of 58,473 preprocessed reviews from the Iranian accommodation platform Jabama, manually annotated for aspects and sentiments. The proposed model achieves a weighted F1-score of 90.6% for ABSA, outperforming baseline BERT (89.25%) and a standard hybrid approach (85.7%). Key efficiency gains include a 39% reduction in GPU power consumption compared to dense BERT, supporting sustainable AI deployment in alignment with UN SDGs 9 and 12. Analysis reveals high mention rates for cleanliness and amenities as critical aspects.

2602.12759v1,Towards a Diagnostic and Predictive Evaluation Methodology for Sequence Labeling Tasks,Elena Alvarez-Mellado; Julio Gonzalo,"Standard evaluation in NLP typically indicates that system A is better on average than system B, but it provides little info on how to improve performance and, what is worse, it should not come as a surprise if B ends up being better than A on outside data. We propose an evaluation methodology for sequence labeling tasks grounded on error analysis that provides both quantitative and qualitative information on where systems must be improved and predicts how models will perform on a different distribution. The key is to create test sets that, contrary to common practice, do not rely on gathering large amounts of real-world in-distribution scraped data, but consists in handcrafting a small set of linguistically motivated examples that exhaustively cover the range of span attributes (such as shape, length, casing, sentence position, etc.) a system may encounter in the wild. We demonstrate this methodology on a benchmark for anglicism identification in Spanish. Our methodology provides results that are diagnostic (because they help identify systematic weaknesses in performance), actionable (because they can inform which model is better suited for a given scenario) and predictive: our method predicts model performance on external datasets with a median correlation of 0.85.",2026-02-13,cs.CL

To address this, we propose Lamer-SSL, a parameter-efficient framework that integrates a Layer-Aware MixturE of LoRA Experts (Lamer) module with a replay strategy. The Lamer module enables flexible balancing between shared and language-specific representations, while layer-aware expert allocation assigns more experts to deeper layers where semantic information is richer. Meanwhile, the replay strategy retains prior knowledge using minimal data, mitigating forgetting during continual training. Experiments on automatic speech recognition (ASR) and language identification (LID) demonstrate that Lamer-SSL extends self-supervised models to new languages effectively while maintaining strong performance on previously learned languages with only 2.14% parameters being trainable.",2026-02-13,cs.CL; eess.AS

Traditional Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) methods rely on linear interaction histories, which struggle to handle long-context tasks, especially those involving information-sparse yet token-heavy visual data in iterative reasoning scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce VimRAG, a framework tailored for multimodal Retrieval-augmented Reasoning across text, images, and videos. Inspired by our systematic study, we model the reasoning process as a dynamic directed acyclic graph that structures the agent states and retrieved multimodal evidence. Building upon this structured memory, we introduce a Graph-Modulated Visual Memory Encoding mechanism, with which the significance of memory nodes is evaluated via their topological position, allowing the model to dynamically allocate high-resolution tokens to pivotal evidence while compressing or discarding trivial clues. To implement this paradigm, we propose a Graph-Guided Policy Optimization strategy. This strategy disentangles step-wise validity from trajectory-level rewards by pruning memory nodes associated with redundant actions, thereby facilitating fine-grained credit assignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VimRAG consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse multimodal RAG benchmarks.

2602.12709v1,ReFilter: Improving Robustness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Gated Filter,Yixin Chen; Ying Xiong; Shangyu Wu; Xiangrui Ke; Nan Guan; Chun Jason Xue,"Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a dominant paradigm for grounding large language models (LLMs) with external evidence in knowledge-intensive question answering. A core design choice is how to fuse retrieved samples into the LLMs, where existing internal fusion approaches broadly fall into query-based fusion, parametric fusion, and latent-based fusion. Despite their effectiveness at modest retrieval scales, these methods often fail to scale gracefully as the number of retrieved candidates k increases: Larger k improves evidence coverage, yet realistic top-k retrieval inevitably contains irrelevant or redundant content and increases the inference cost.   To address these limitations, we propose ReFilter, a novel latent-based fusion framework that performs token-level filtering and fusion. ReFilter consists of three key components: a context encoder for encoding context features, a gated filter for weighting each token, and a token fusion module for integrating the weighted token feature into the LLM's hidden states. Our experiments across four general-domain QA benchmarks show that ReFilter consistently achieves the best average performance under both in-domain adaptation and out-of-domain transfer. ReFilter further generalizes to five biomedical QA benchmarks in zero-shot transfer without domain fine-tuning, reaching 70.01% average accuracy with Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct.",2026-02-13,cs.CL

2602.12674v1,$\mathcal{X}$-KD: General Experiential Knowledge Distillation for Large Language Models,Yuang Cai; Yuyu Yuan,"Knowledge Distillation (KD) for Large Language Models (LLMs) has become increasingly important as models grow in size and complexity. While existing distillation approaches focus on imitating teacher behavior, they often overlook the original learning environment that shaped the teacher's knowledge. Inspired by the experiential learning theory and inverse reinforcement learning, we propose Experiential Knowledge Distillation ($\mathcal{X}$-KD), a novel and general framework that enables student models to learn in the teacher's original learning environment. $\mathcal{X}$-KD adopts the Approximated Variational Reward Imitation Learning (AVRIL) framework to jointly model the teacher's original reward function and perform policy distillation, encouraging consistency between the student policy and the original reward function. Our derivation demonstrates that $\mathcal{X}$-KD follows the supervised learning framework and applies to both sequence-level and divergence-based distillation methods, underlining the simplicity and flexibility of our approach. Empirical results show that $\mathcal{X}$-KD outperforms the generalized KD and MiniLLM baselines on abstractive summarization, machine translation, and arithmetic reasoning tasks. Additionally, $\mathcal{X}$-KD achieves better performance-diversity trade-off and data efficiency than baseline KD approaches.",2026-02-13,cs.CL

However, current agents typically rely on fixed cognitive patterns: non-thinking models generate immediate responses, while thinking models engage in deep reasoning uniformly. This rigidity is inefficient for long-horizon tasks, where cognitive demands vary significantly from step to step, with some requiring strategic planning and others only routine execution. In this paper, we introduce CogRouter, a framework that trains agents to dynamically adapt cognitive depth at each step. Grounded in ACT-R theory, we design four hierarchical cognitive levels ranging from instinctive responses to strategic planning. Our two-stage training approach includes Cognition-aware Supervised Fine-tuning (CoSFT) to instill stable level-specific patterns, and Cognition-aware Policy Optimization (CoPO) for step-level credit assignment via confidence-aware advantage reweighting. The key insight is that appropriate cognitive depth should maximize the confidence of the resulting action. Experiments on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld demonstrate that CogRouter achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior efficiency.

2602.12660v1,Learning Ordinal Probabilistic Reward from Preferences,Longze Chen; Lu Wang; Renke Shan; Ze Gong; Run Luo; Jiaming Li; Jing Luo; Qiyao Wang; Min Yang,"Reward models are crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and intentions. Existing approaches follow either Generative (GRMs) or Discriminative (DRMs) paradigms, yet both suffer from limitations: GRMs typically demand costly point-wise supervision, while DRMs produce uncalibrated relative scores that lack probabilistic interpretation. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel reward modeling paradigm: Probabilistic Reward Model (PRM). Instead of modeling reward as a deterministic scalar, our approach treats it as a random variable, learning a full probability distribution for the quality of each response. To make this paradigm practical, we present its closed-form, discrete realization: the Ordinal Probabilistic Reward Model (OPRM), which discretizes the quality score into a finite set of ordinal ratings. Building on OPRM, we propose a data-efficient training strategy called Region Flooding Tuning (RgFT). It enables rewards to better reflect absolute text quality by incorporating quality-level annotations, which guide the model to concentrate the probability mass within corresponding rating sub-regions. Experiments on various reward model benchmarks show that our method improves accuracy by $\textbf{2.9%}\sim\textbf{7.4%}$ compared to prior reward models, demonstrating strong performance and data efficiency. Analysis of the score distribution provides evidence that our method captures not only relative rankings but also absolute quality.",2026-02-13,cs.CL
2602.12642v1,Beyond Normalization: Rethinking the Partition Function as a Difficulty Scheduler for RLVR,Dohyung Kim; Minbeom Kim; Jeonghye Kim; Sangmook Lee; Sojeong Rhee; Kyomin Jung,"Reward-maximizing RL methods enhance the reasoning performance of LLMs, but often reduce the diversity among outputs. Recent works address this issue by adopting GFlowNets, training LLMs to match a target distribution while jointly learning its partition function. In contrast to prior works that treat this partition function solely as a normalizer, we reinterpret it as a per-prompt expected-reward (i.e., online accuracy) signal, leveraging this unused information to improve sample efficiency. Specifically, we first establish a theoretical relationship between the partition function and per-prompt accuracy estimates. Building on this key insight, we propose Partition Function-Guided RL (PACED-RL), a post-training framework that leverages accuracy estimates to prioritize informative question prompts during training, and further improves sample efficiency through an accuracy estimate error-prioritized replay. Crucially, both components reuse information already produced during GFlowNet training, effectively amortizing the compute overhead into the existing optimization process. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate strong performance improvements over GRPO and prior GFlowNet approaches, highlighting PACED-RL as a promising direction for a more sample efficient distribution-matching training for LLMs.",2026-02-13,cs.CL; cs.AI
2602.12639v1,CLASE: A Hybrid Method for Chinese Legalese Stylistic Evaluation,Yiran Rex Ma; Yuxiao Ye; Huiyuan Xie,"Legal text generated by large language models (LLMs) can usually achieve reasonable factual accuracy, but it frequently fails to adhere to the specialised stylistic norms and linguistic conventions of legal writing. In order to improve stylistic quality, a crucial first step is to establish a reliable evaluation method. However, having legal experts manually develop such a metric is impractical, as the implicit stylistic requirements in legal writing practice are difficult to formalise into explicit rubrics. Meanwhile, existing automatic evaluation methods also fall short: reference-based metrics conflate semantic accuracy with stylistic fidelity, and LLM-as-a-judge evaluations suffer from opacity and inconsistency. To address these challenges, we introduce CLASE (Chinese LegAlese Stylistic Evaluation), a hybrid evaluation method that focuses on the stylistic performance of legal text. The method incorporates a hybrid scoring mechanism that combines 1) linguistic feature-based scores and 2) experience-guided LLM-as-a-judge scores. Both the feature coefficients and the LLM scoring experiences are learned from contrastive pairs of authentic legal documents and their LLM-restored counterparts. This hybrid design captures both surface-level features and implicit stylistic norms in a transparent, reference-free manner. Experiments on 200 Chinese legal documents show that CLASE achieves substantially higher alignment with human judgments than traditional metrics and pure LLM-as-a-judge methods. Beyond improved alignment, CLASE provides interpretable score breakdowns and suggestions for improvements, offering a scalable and practical solution for professional stylistic evaluation in legal text generation (Code and data for CLASE is available at: https://github.com/rexera/CLASE).",2026-02-13,cs.CL

Prior pruning methods operate either before the LLM, limiting generality due to diverse encoder-projector designs or within the LLM using heuristics that are incompatible with FlashAttention. We take a different approach: rather than identifying unimportant tokens, we treat the LLM itself as the optimal guide for compression. Observing that deeper layers naturally transmit vision-to-text information, we introduce Attention-Driven Self-Compression (ADSC), a simple, broadly applicable method that progressively reduces vision tokens using only the LLM's attention mechanism. Our method applies uniform token downsampling at selected layers, forming bottlenecks that encourage the model to reorganize and compress information into the remaining tokens. It requires no score computation, auxiliary modules, or attention modification, and remains fully compatible with FlashAttention. Applied to LLaVA-1.5, ADSC reduces FLOPs by 53.7% and peak KV-cache memory by 56.7%, while preserving 98.2% of the original model performance. Across multiple benchmarks, it outperforms prior pruning approaches in both efficiency and accuracy.

2602.12601v1,HyperMLP: An Integrated Perspective for Sequence Modeling,Jiecheng Lu; Shihao Yang,"Self-attention is often viewed as probabilistic query-key lookup, motivating designs that preserve normalized attention scores and fixed positional semantics. We advocate a simpler and more unified perspective: an autoregressive attention head can be viewed as a dynamic two-layer MLP whose weights are instantiated from the context history. From this view, attention scores form an ever-growing hidden representation, and standard MLP activations such as ReLU or GLU naturally implement input-conditioned selection over a context-dependent memory pool rather than a probability distribution. Based on this formulation, we introduce HyperMLP and HyperGLU, which learn dynamic mixing in both feature space and sequence space, using a reverse-offset (lag) layout to align temporal mixing with autoregressive semantics. We provide theoretical characterizations of the expressivity and implications of this structure, and empirically show that HyperMLP/HyperGLU consistently outperform strong softmax-attention baselines under matched parameter budgets.",2026-02-13,cs.LG; cs.AI; cs.CL; stat.ML
2602.12575v1,Discovering Semantic Latent Structures in Psychological Scales: A Response-Free Pathway to Efficient Simplification,Bo Wang; Yuxuan Zhang; Yueqin Hu; Hanchao Hou; Kaiping Peng; Shiguang Ni,"Psychological scale refinement traditionally relies on response-based methods such as factor analysis, item response theory, and network psychometrics to optimize item composition. Although rigorous, these approaches require large samples and may be constrained by data availability and cross-cultural comparability. Recent advances in natural language processing suggest that the semantic structure of questionnaire items may encode latent construct organization, offering a complementary response-free perspective. We introduce a topic-modeling framework that operationalizes semantic latent structure for scale simplification. Items are encoded using contextual sentence embeddings and grouped via density-based clustering to discover latent semantic factors without predefining their number. Class-based term weighting derives interpretable topic representations that approximate constructs and enable merging of semantically adjacent clusters. Representative items are selected using membership criteria within an integrated reduction pipeline. We benchmarked the framework across DASS, IPIP, and EPOCH, evaluating structural recovery, internal consistency, factor congruence, correlation preservation, and reduction efficiency. The proposed method recovered coherent factor-like groupings aligned with established constructs. Selected items reduced scale length by 60.5% on average while maintaining psychometric adequacy. Simplified scales showed high concordance with original factor structures and preserved inter-factor correlations, indicating that semantic latent organization provides a response-free approximation of measurement structure. Our framework formalizes semantic structure as an inspectable front-end for scale construction and reduction. To facilitate adoption, we provide a visualization-supported tool enabling one-click semantic analysis and structured simplification.",2026-02-13,cs.CL; cs.LG

The model uses a modality-aware sparse mixture of experts (MoE): disjoint expert pools for speech and text with hard routing and top-1 selection, embedded in hybrid-causality Conformer blocks (bidirectional for speech, causal for text). Training combines CTC on speech positions with label-smoothed cross-entropy for text generation.

While this paradigm better exploits the reasoning and contextual understanding capabilities of LLMs, most existing LLM-based rerankers rely on autoregressive generation, which limits their efficiency and flexibility. In particular, token-by-token decoding incurs high latency, while the fixed left-to-right generation order causes early prediction errors to propagate and is difficult to revise. To address these limitations, we explore the use of diffusion language models (dLLMs) for document reranking and propose DiffuRank, a reranking framework built upon dLLMs. Unlike autoregressive models, dLLMs support more flexible decoding and generation processes that are not constrained to a left-to-right order, and enable parallel decoding, which may lead to improved efficiency and controllability. Specifically, we investigate three reranking strategies based on dLLMs: (1) a pointwise approach that uses dLLMs to estimate the relevance of each query-document pair; (2) a logit-based listwise approach that prompts dLLMs to jointly assess the relevance of multiple documents and derives ranking lists directly from model logits; and (3) a permutation-based listwise approach that adapts the canonical decoding process of dLLMs to the reranking tasks. For each approach, we design corresponding training methods to fully exploit the advantages of dLLMs. We evaluate both zero-shot and fine-tuned reranking performance on multiple benchmarks. Experimental results show that dLLMs achieve performance comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of autoregressive LLMs with similar model sizes. These findings demonstrate the promise of diffusion-based language models as a compelling alternative to autoregressive architectures for document reranking.",2026-02-13,cs.IR; cs.CL

While longer reasoning traces can improve answer quality and unlock abilities such as self-correction, they also incur high inference costs and often introduce redundant steps, known as overthinking. Recent research seeks to develop efficient reasoning strategies that balance reasoning length and accuracy, either through length-aware reward design or prompt-based calibration. However, these heuristic-based approaches may suffer from severe accuracy drop and be very sensitive to hyperparameters. To address these problems, we introduce CRT (Constraint-Rectified Training), a principled post-training framework based on reference-guarded constrained optimization, yielding a more stable and interpretable formulation for efficient reasoning. CRT alternates between minimizing reasoning length and rectifying accuracy only when performance falls below the reference, enabling stable and effective pruning of redundant reasoning. We further extend CRT with a two-stage training scheme that first discovers the shortest reliable reasoning patterns and then refines accuracy under a learnt length budget, preventing the re-emergence of verbose CoT. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that this framework consistently reduces token usage while maintaining answer quality at a robust and reliable level. Further analysis reveals that CRT improves reasoning efficiency not only by shortening responses but also by reducing internal language redundancy, leading to a new evaluation metric. Moreover, CRT-based training naturally yields a sequence of intermediate checkpoints that span a spectrum of explanation lengths while preserving correctness, enabling fine-grained control over reasoning verbosity without retraining.",2026-02-13,cs.LG; cs.CL
2602.13166v1,Optimal Take-off under Fuzzy Clearances,Hugo Henry; Arthur Tsai; Kelly Cohen,"This paper presents a hybrid obstacle avoidance architecture that integrates Optimal Control under clearance with a Fuzzy Rule Based System (FRBS) to enable adaptive constraint handling for unmanned aircraft. Motivated by the limitations of classical optimal control under uncertainty and the need for interpretable decision making in safety critical aviation systems, we design a three stage Takagi Sugeno Kang fuzzy layer that modulates constraint radii, urgency levels, and activation decisions based on regulatory separation minima and airworthiness guidelines from FAA and EASA. These fuzzy-derived clearances are then incorporated as soft constraints into an optimal control problem solved using the FALCON toolbox and IPOPT. The framework aims to reduce unnecessary recomputations by selectively activating obstacle avoidance updates while maintaining compliance with aviation procedures. A proof of concept implementation using a simplified aircraft model demonstrates that the approach can generate optimal trajectories with computation times of 2,3 seconds per iteration in a single threaded MATLAB environment, suggesting feasibility for near real time applications. However, our experiments revealed a critical software incompatibility in the latest versions of FALCON and IPOPT, in which the Lagrangian penalty term remained identically zero, preventing proper constraint enforcement. This behavior was consistent across scenarios and indicates a solver toolbox regression rather than a modeling flaw. Future work includes validating this effect by reverting to earlier software versions, optimizing the fuzzy membership functions using evolutionary methods, and extending the system to higher fidelity aircraft models and stochastic obstacle environments.",2026-02-13,cs.AI
2602.13165v1,Asynchronous Verified Semantic Caching for Tiered LLM Architectures,Asmit Kumar Singh; Haozhe Wang; Laxmi Naga Santosh Attaluri; Tak Chiam; Weihua Zhu,"Large language models (LLMs) now sit in the critical path of search, assistance, and agentic workflows, making semantic caching essential for reducing inference cost and latency. Production deployments typically use a tiered static-dynamic design: a static cache of curated, offline vetted responses mined from logs, backed by a dynamic cache populated online. In practice, both tiers are commonly governed by a single embedding similarity threshold, which induces a hard tradeoff: conservative thresholds miss safe reuse opportunities, while aggressive thresholds risk serving semantically incorrect responses. We introduce \textbf{Krites}, an asynchronous, LLM-judged caching policy that expands static coverage without changing serving decisions. On the critical path, Krites behaves exactly like a standard static threshold policy. When the nearest static neighbor of the prompt falls just below the static threshold, Krites asynchronously invokes an LLM judge to verify whether the static response is acceptable for the new prompt. Approved matches are promoted into the dynamic cache, allowing future repeats and paraphrases to reuse curated static answers and expanding static reach over time. In trace-driven simulations on conversational and search workloads, Krites increases the fraction of requests served with curated static answers (direct static hits plus verified promotions) by up to $\textbf{3.9}$ times for conversational traffic and search-style queries relative to tuned baselines, with unchanged critical path latency.",2026-02-13,cs.IR; cs.AI
2602.13156v1,In-Context Autonomous Network Incident Response: An End-to-End Large Language Model Agent Approach,Yiran Gao; Kim Hammar; Tao Li,"Rapidly evolving cyberattacks demand incident response systems that can autonomously learn and adapt to changing threats. Prior work has extensively explored the reinforcement learning approach, which involves learning response strategies through extensive simulation of the incident. While this approach can be effective, it requires handcrafted modeling of the simulator and suppresses useful semantics from raw system logs and alerts. To address these limitations, we propose to leverage large language models' (LLM) pre-trained security knowledge and in-context learning to create an end-to-end agentic solution for incident response planning. Specifically, our agent integrates four functionalities, perception, reasoning, planning, and action, into one lightweight LLM (14b model). Through fine-tuning and chain-of-thought reasoning, our LLM agent is capable of processing system logs and inferring the underlying network state (perception), updating its conjecture of attack models (reasoning), simulating consequences under different response strategies (planning), and generating an effective response (action). By comparing LLM-simulated outcomes with actual observations, the LLM agent repeatedly refines its attack conjecture and corresponding response, thereby demonstrating in-context adaptation. Our agentic approach is free of modeling and can run on commodity hardware. When evaluated on incident logs reported in the literature, our agent achieves recovery up to 23% faster than those of frontier LLMs.",2026-02-13,cs.CR; cs.AI

ABA frameworks with an underlying atomic language are widely studied, but their applicability is limited by a representational restriction to ground (variable-free) arguments and attacks built from propositional atoms. In this paper, we lift this restriction and propose a novel notion of constrained ABA (CABA), whose components, as well as arguments built from them, may include constrained variables, ranging over possibly infinite domains. We define non-ground semantics for CABA, in terms of various notions of non-ground attacks. We show that the new semantics conservatively generalise standard ABA semantics.",2026-02-13,cs.AI; cs.LO
2602.13106v1,Which Algorithms Can Graph Neural Networks Learn?,Solveig Wittig; Antonis Vasileiou; Robert R. Nerem; Timo Stoll; Floris Geerts; Yusu Wang; Christopher Morris,"In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding neural architectures' ability to learn to execute discrete algorithms, a line of work often referred to as neural algorithmic reasoning. The goal is to integrate algorithmic reasoning capabilities into larger neural pipelines. Many such architectures are based on (message-passing) graph neural networks (MPNNs), owing to their permutation equivariance and ability to deal with sparsity and variable-sized inputs. However, existing work is either largely empirical and lacks formal guarantees or it focuses solely on expressivity, leaving open the question of when and how such architectures generalize beyond a finite training set. In this work, we propose a general theoretical framework that characterizes the sufficient conditions under which MPNNs can learn an algorithm from a training set of small instances and provably approximate its behavior on inputs of arbitrary size. Our framework applies to a broad class of algorithms, including single-source shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, and general dynamic programming problems, such as the $0$-$1$ knapsack problem. In addition, we establish impossibility results for a wide range of algorithmic tasks, showing that standard MPNNs cannot learn them, and we derive more expressive MPNN-like architectures that overcome these limitations. Finally, we refine our analysis for the Bellman-Ford algorithm, yielding a substantially smaller required training set and significantly extending the recent work of Nerem et al. [2025] by allowing for a differentiable regularization loss. Empirical results largely support our theoretical findings.",2026-02-13,cs.LG; cs.AI; cs.DS; cs.NE

Van Bavel; Sander van der Linden; Rory White; Live Leonhardsen Wilhelmsen,"The distinction between genuine grassroots activism and automated influence operations is collapsing. While policy debates focus on bot farms, a distinct threat to democracy is emerging via partisan coordination apps and artificial intelligence-what we term 'cyborg propaganda.' This architecture combines large numbers of verified humans with adaptive algorithmic automation, enabling a closed-loop system. AI tools monitor online sentiment to optimize directives and generate personalized content for users to post online. Cyborg propaganda thereby exploits a critical legal shield: by relying on verified citizens to ratify and disseminate messages, these campaigns operate in a regulatory gray zone, evading liability frameworks designed for automated botnets. We explore the collective action paradox of this technology: does it democratize power by 'unionizing' influence (pooling the reach of dispersed citizens to overcome the algorithmic invisibility of isolated voices), or does it reduce citizens to 'cognitive proxies' of a central directive? We argue that cyborg propaganda fundamentally alters the digital public square, shifting political discourse from a democratic contest of individual ideas to a battle of algorithmic campaigns. We outline a research agenda to distinguish organic from coordinated information diffusion and propose governance frameworks to address the regulatory challenges of AI-assisted collective expression.",2026-02-13,cs.CY; cs.AI

While Explainable AI (XAI) techniques aim to make model decisions more transparent, their effectiveness is often hindered by the high dimensionality and noise present in raw time series data. In this work, we investigate whether transforming time series into discrete latent representations-using methods such as Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) and Discrete Variational Autoencoders (DVAE)-not only preserves but enhances explainability by reducing redundancy and focusing on the most informative patterns. We show that applying XAI methods to these compressed representations leads to concise and structured explanations that maintain faithfulness without sacrificing classification performance. Additionally, we propose Similar Subsequence Accuracy (SSA), a novel metric that quantitatively assesses the alignment between XAI-identified salient subsequences and the label distribution in the training data. SSA provides a systematic way to validate whether the features highlighted by XAI methods are truly representative of the learned classification patterns. Our findings demonstrate that discrete latent representations not only retain the essential characteristics needed for classification but also offer a pathway to more compact, interpretable, and computationally efficient explanations in time series analysis.",2026-02-13,cs.LG; cs.AI
2602.13071v1,Bus-Conditioned Zero-Shot Trajectory Generation via Task Arithmetic,Shuai Liu; Ning Cao; Yile Chen; Yue Jiang; Gao Cong,"Mobility trajectory data provide essential support for smart city applications. However, such data are often difficult to obtain. Meanwhile, most existing trajectory generation methods implicitly assume that at least a subset of real mobility data from target city is available, which limits their applicability in data-inaccessible scenarios. In this work, we propose a new problem setting, called bus-conditioned zero-shot trajectory generation, where no mobility trajectories from a target city are accessible. The generation process relies solely on source city mobility data and publicly available bus timetables from both cities. Under this setting, we propose MobTA, the first approach to introduce task arithmetic into trajectory generation. MobTA models the parameter shift from bus-timetable-based trajectory generation to mobility trajectory generation in source city, and applies this shift to target city through arithmetic operations on task vectors. This enables trajectory generation that reflects target-city mobility patterns without requiring any real mobility data from it. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze MobTA's stability across base and instruction-tuned LLMs. Extensive experiments show that MobTA significantly outperforms existing methods, and achieves performance close to models finetuned using target city mobility trajectories.",2026-02-13,cs.LG; cs.AI

However, deployment in safety-critical settings is hindered by a critical extrapolation hazard: driven by smoothness biases, flow models yield plausible outputs even for off-manifold conditions, resulting in silent failures indistinguishable from valid predictions. In this work, we introduce Diverging Flows, a novel approach that enables a single model to simultaneously perform conditional generation and native extrapolation detection by structurally enforcing inefficient transport for off-manifold inputs. We evaluate our method on synthetic manifolds, cross-domain style transfer, and weather temperature forecasting, demonstrating that it achieves effective detection of extrapolations without compromising predictive fidelity or inference latency. These results establish Diverging Flows as a robust solution for trustworthy flow models, paving the way for reliable deployment in domains such as medicine, robotics, and climate science.",2026-02-13,cs.LG; cs.AI; stat.ML
2602.13055v1,Curriculum-DPO++: Direct Preference Optimization via Data and Model Curricula for Text-to-Image Generation,Florinel-Alin Croitoru; Vlad Hondru; Radu Tudor Ionescu; Nicu Sebe; Mubarak Shah,"Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed as an effective and efficient alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, neither RLHF nor DPO take into account the fact that learning certain preferences is more difficult than learning other preferences, rendering the optimization process suboptimal. To address this gap in text-to-image generation, we recently proposed Curriculum-DPO, a method that organizes image pairs by difficulty. In this paper, we introduce Curriculum-DPO++, an enhanced method that combines the original data-level curriculum with a novel model-level curriculum. More precisely, we propose to dynamically increase the learning capacity of the denoising network as training advances. We implement this capacity increase via two mechanisms. First, we initialize the model with only a subset of the trainable layers used in the original Curriculum-DPO. As training progresses, we sequentially unfreeze layers until the configuration matches the full baseline architecture. Second, as the fine-tuning is based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we implement a progressive schedule for the dimension of the low-rank matrices. Instead of maintaining a fixed capacity, we initialize the low-rank matrices with a dimension significantly smaller than that of the baseline. As training proceeds, we incrementally increase their rank, allowing the capacity to grow until it converges to the same rank value as in Curriculum-DPO. Furthermore, we propose an alternative ranking strategy to the one employed by Curriculum-DPO. Finally, we compare Curriculum-DPO++ against Curriculum-DPO and other state-of-the-art preference optimization approaches on nine benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference.

2602.13045v1,Geometric Manifold Rectification for Imbalanced Learning,Xubin Wang; Qing Li; Weijia Jia,"Imbalanced classification presents a formidable challenge in machine learning, particularly when tabular datasets are plagued by noise and overlapping class boundaries. From a geometric perspective, the core difficulty lies in the topological intrusion of the majority class into the minority manifold, which obscures the true decision boundary. Traditional undersampling techniques, such as Edited Nearest Neighbours (ENN), typically employ symmetric cleaning rules and uniform voting, failing to capture the local manifold structure and often inadvertently removing informative minority samples. In this paper, we propose GMR (Geometric Manifold Rectification), a novel framework designed to robustly handle imbalanced structured data by exploiting local geometric priors. GMR makes two contributions: (1) Geometric confidence estimation that uses inverse-distance weighted kNN voting with an adaptive distance metric to capture local reliability; and (2) asymmetric cleaning that is strict on majority samples while conservatively protecting minority samples via a safe-guarding cap on minority removal. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that GMR is competitive with strong sampling baselines.",2026-02-13,cs.LG; cs.AI

However, existing approaches often fall into the Pseudo-Equation Trap: producing equations that fit observations well but remain inconsistent with fundamental scientific principles. A key reason is that these approaches are dominated by empirical risk minimization, lacking explicit constraints to ensure scientific consistency. To bridge this gap, we propose PG-SR, a prior-guided SR framework built upon a three-stage pipeline consisting of warm-up, evolution, and refinement. Throughout the pipeline, PG-SR introduces a prior constraint checker that explicitly encodes domain priors as executable constraint programs, and employs a Prior Annealing Constrained Evaluation (PACE) mechanism during the evolution stage to progressively steer discovery toward scientifically consistent regions. Theoretically, we prove that PG-SR reduces the Rademacher complexity of the hypothesis space, yielding tighter generalization bounds and establishing a guarantee against pseudo-equations. Experimentally, PG-SR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse domains, maintaining robustness to varying prior quality, noisy data, and data scarcity.",2026-02-13,cs.LG; cs.AI

We show that liquid-capacitance-extended models lead to interpretable behavior even in dense, all-to-all recurrent neural network (RNN) policies. We further demonstrate that incorporating chemical synapses improves interpretability and that combining chemical synapses with synaptic activation yields the most accurate and interpretable RNN models. To assess the accuracy and interpretability of these RNN policies, we consider the challenging lane-keeping control task and evaluate performance across multiple metrics, including turn-weighted validation loss, neural activity during driving, absolute correlation between neural activity and road trajectory, saliency maps of the networks' attention, and the robustness of their saliency maps measured by the structural similarity index.",2026-02-13,cs.NE; cs.AI; cs.LG
2602.12983v1,Detecting Object Tracking Failure via Sequential Hypothesis Testing,Alejandro Monroy Muñoz; Rajeev Verma; Alexander Timans,"Real-time online object tracking in videos constitutes a core task in computer vision, with wide-ranging applications including video surveillance, motion capture, and robotics. Deployed tracking systems usually lack formal safety assurances to convey when tracking is reliable and when it may fail, at best relying on heuristic measures of model confidence to raise alerts. To obtain such assurances we propose interpreting object tracking as a sequential hypothesis test, wherein evidence for or against tracking failures is gradually accumulated over time. Leveraging recent advancements in the field, our sequential test (formalized as an e-process) quickly identifies when tracking failures set in whilst provably containing false alerts at a desired rate, and thus limiting potentially costly re-calibration or intervention steps. The approach is computationally light-weight, requires no extra training or fine-tuning, and is in principle model-agnostic. We propose both supervised and unsupervised variants by leveraging either ground-truth or solely internal tracking information, and demonstrate its effectiveness for two established tracking models across four video benchmarks. As such, sequential testing can offer a statistically grounded and efficient mechanism to incorporate safety assurances into real-time tracking systems.",2026-02-13,cs.CV; cs.AI

Real-Time Chunking (RTC) alleviates this issue but is external to the policy, leading to spurious multimodal switching and trajectories that are not intrinsically smooth. We propose Legato, a training-time continuation method for action-chunked flow-based VLA policies. Specifically, Legato initializes denoising from a schedule-shaped mixture of known actions and noise, exposing the model to partial action information. Moreover, Legato reshapes the learned flow dynamics to ensure that the denoising process remains consistent between training and inference under per-step guidance. Legato further uses randomized schedule condition during training to support varying inference delays and achieve controllable smoothness. Empirically, Legato produces smoother trajectories and reduces spurious multimodal switching during execution, leading to less hesitation and shorter task completion time. Extensive real-world experiments show that Legato consistently outperforms RTC across five manipulation tasks, achieving approximately 10% improvements in both trajectory smoothness and task completion time.",2026-02-13,cs.RO; cs.AI

Polycarpou,"In today's digital world, the generation of vast amounts of streaming data in various domains has become ubiquitous. However, many of these data are unlabeled, making it challenging to identify events, particularly anomalies. This task becomes even more formidable in nonstationary environments where model performance can deteriorate over time due to concept drift. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel method, VAE++ESDD, which employs incremental learning and two-level ensembling: an ensemble of Variational AutoEncoder(VAEs) for anomaly prediction, along with an ensemble of concept drift detectors. Each drift detector utilizes a statistical-based concept drift mechanism. To evaluate the effectiveness of VAE++ESDD, we conduct a comprehensive experimental study using real-world and synthetic datasets characterized by severely or extremely low anomalous rates and various drift characteristics. Our study reveals that the proposed method significantly outperforms both strong baselines and state-of-the-art methods.",2026-02-13,cs.LG; cs.AI

The metric can be viewed as an extension of the well-known Expected Calibration Error (ECE) which assesses the calibration of the maximum probability or confidence. Other ways of measuring the variation of a probability distribution exist which have the advantage of taking into account the full probability distribution, for example the Shannon entropy. We show how the ECE approach can be extended from assessing confidence calibration to assessing the calibration of any metric of variation. We present numerical examples upon synthetic predictions which are perfectly calibrated by design, demonstrating that, in this scenario, the VCE has the desired property of approaching zero as the number of data samples increases, in contrast to another entropy-based calibration metric (the UCE) which has been proposed in the literature.",2026-02-13,cs.LG; cs.AI
2602.12963v1,Information-theoretic analysis of world models in optimal reward maximizers,Alfred Harwood; Jose Faustino; Alex Altair,"An important question in the field of AI is the extent to which successful behaviour requires an internal representation of the world. In this work, we quantify the amount of information an optimal policy provides about the underlying environment. We consider a Controlled Markov Process (CMP) with $n$ states and $m$ actions, assuming a uniform prior over the space of possible transition dynamics. We prove that observing a deterministic policy that is optimal for any non-constant reward function then conveys exactly $n \log m$ bits of information about the environment. Specifically, we show that the mutual information between the environment and the optimal policy is $n \log m$ bits. This bound holds across a broad class of objectives, including finite-horizon, infinite-horizon discounted, and time-averaged reward maximization. These findings provide a precise information-theoretic lower bound on the ""implicit world model'' necessary for optimality.",2026-02-13,cs.AI

Meanwhile, transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have become dominant, with rapidly increasing model sizes but low degree of parameter reuse compared to conventional CNNs, making end-to-end execution on resource-limited devices extremely challenging. To address these challenges, we propose TriGen, a novel NPU architecture tailored for resource-constrained environments through software-hardware co-design. Firstly, TriGen adopts low-precision computation using microscaling (MX) to enable additional optimization opportunities while preserving accuracy, and resolves the issues that arise by employing such precision. Secondly, to jointly optimize both nonlinear and linear operations, TriGen eliminates the need for specialized hardware for essential nonlinear operations by using fast and accurate LUT, thereby maximizing performance gains and reducing hardware-cost in on-device environments, and finally, by taking practical hardware constraints into account, further employs scheduling techniques to maximize computational utilization even under limited on-chip memory capacity. We evaluate the performance of TriGen on various LLMs and show that TriGen achieves an average 2.73x performance speedup and 52% less memory transfer over the baseline NPU design with negligible accuracy loss.",2026-02-13,cs.AR; cs.AI

While recent work has shown that such updates can be transferred between models with identical architectures, transferring them across models of different widths remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce Theseus, a training-free method for transporting task-specific updates across heterogeneous models. Rather than matching parameters directly, we characterize a task update by the functional effect it induces on intermediate representations. We formalize task-vector transport as a functional matching problem on observed activations and show that, after aligning representation spaces via orthogonal Procrustes analysis, it admits a stable closed-form solution that preserves the geometry of the update. We evaluate Theseus on vision and language models across different widths, showing consistent improvements over strong baselines without additional training or backpropagation.

Wielenberg; Ilinca Popp; Oliver Blanck; Lucas Zander; Jan C. Peeken; Stephanie E. Combs; Anca-Ligia Grosu; Dimos Baltas; Tobias Fechter,"Melanoma brain metastases (MBM) are common and spatially heterogeneous lesions, complicating cohort-level analyses due to anatomical variability and differing MRI protocols. We propose a fully differentiable, deep-learning-based deformable registration framework that aligns individual pathological brains to a common atlas while preserving metastatic tissue without requiring lesion masks or preprocessing.   Missing anatomical correspondences caused by metastases are handled through a forward-model similarity metric based on distance-transformed anatomical labels, combined with a volume-preserving regularization term to ensure deformation plausibility. Registration performance was evaluated using Dice coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance (HD), average symmetric surface distance (ASSD), and Jacobian-based measures. The method was applied to 209 MBM patients from three centres, enabling standardized mapping of metastases to anatomical, arterial, and perfusion atlases.   The framework achieved high registration accuracy across datasets (DSC 0.89-0.92, HD 6.79-7.60 mm, ASSD 0.63-0.77 mm) while preserving metastatic volumes. Spatial analysis demonstrated significant over-representation of MBM in the cerebral cortex and putamen, under-representation in white matter, and consistent localization near the gray-white matter junction. No arterial territory showed increased metastasis frequency after volume correction.   This approach enables robust atlas registration of pathological brain MRI without lesion masks and supports reproducible multi-centre analyses. Applied to MBM, it confirms and refines known spatial predilections, particularly preferential seeding near the gray-white matter junction and cortical regions. The publicly available implementation facilitates reproducible research and extension to other brain tumours and neurological pathologies.",2026-02-13,cs.CV; cs.AI; physics.med-ph
2602.12924v1,Never say never: Exploring the effects of available knowledge on agent persuasiveness in controlled physiotherapy motivation dialogues,Stephan Vonschallen; Rahel Häusler; Theresa Schmiedel; Friederike Eyssel,"Generative Social Agents (GSAs) are increasingly impacting human users through persuasive means. On the one hand, they might motivate users to pursue personal goals, such as healthier lifestyles. On the other hand, they are associated with potential risks like manipulation and deception, which are induced by limited control over probabilistic agent outputs. However, as GSAs manifest communicative patterns based on available knowledge, their behavior may be regulated through their access to such knowledge. Following this approach, we explored persuasive ChatGPT-generated messages in the context of human-robot physiotherapy motivation. We did so by comparing ChatGPT-generated responses to predefined inputs from a hypothetical physiotherapy patient. In Study 1, we qualitatively analyzed 13 ChatGPT-generated dialogue scripts with varying knowledge configurations regarding persuasive message characteristics. In Study 2, third-party observers (N = 27) rated a selection of these dialogues in terms of the agent's expressiveness, assertiveness, and persuasiveness. Our findings indicate that LLM-based GSAs can adapt assertive and expressive personality traits -- significantly enhancing perceived persuasiveness. Moreover, persuasiveness significantly benefited from the availability of information about the patients' age and past profession, mediated by perceived assertiveness and expressiveness. Contextual knowledge about physiotherapy benefits did not significantly impact persuasiveness, possibly because the LLM had inherent knowledge about such benefits even without explicit prompting. Overall, the study highlights the importance of empirically studying behavioral patterns of GSAs, specifically in terms of what information generative AI systems require for consistent and responsible communication.",2026-02-13,cs.HC; cs.AI

EPRBench comprises 10K event sequences and 65K event frames, collected using both handheld and vehicle-mounted setups to comprehensively capture real-world challenges across diverse viewpoints, weather conditions, and lighting scenarios. To support semantic-aware and language-integrated VPR research, we provide LLM-generated scene descriptions, subsequently refined through human annotation, establishing a solid foundation for integrating LLMs into event-based perception pipelines. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we implement and benchmark 15 state-of-the-art VPR algorithms on EPRBench, offering a strong baseline for future algorithmic comparisons. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal fusion paradigm for VPR: leveraging LLMs to generate textual scene descriptions from raw event streams, which then guide spatially attentive token selection, cross-modal feature fusion, and multi-scale representation learning.

In clinical practice, the gold standard for diagnosis is dynamic X-ray imaging. However, X-ray provides only 2D motion information, while 3D modalities such as computed tomography (CT) or cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) cannot efficiently capture motion. Therefore, there is a need for a system capable of visualizing real-time 3D spinal motion while minimizing radiation exposure.   Methods: We propose ultrasound as an auxiliary modality for 3D spine visualization. Due to acoustic limitations, ultrasound captures only the superficial spinal surface. Therefore, the partially compounded ultrasound volume is registered to preoperative 3D imaging. In this study, CBCT provides the neutral spine configuration, while robotic ultrasound acquisition is performed at maximal spinal bending. A kinematic model is applied to the CBCT-derived spine model for coarse registration, followed by ICP for fine registration, with kinematic parameters optimized based on the registration results. Real-time ultrasound motion tracking is then used to estimate continuous 3D spinal motion by interpolating between the neutral and maximally bent states.   Results: The pipeline was evaluated on a bendable 3D-printed lumbar spine phantom. The registration error was $1.941 \pm 0.199$ mm and the interpolated spinal motion error was $2.01 \pm 0.309$ mm (median).   Conclusion: The proposed robotic ultrasound framework enables radiation-reduced, real-time 3D visualization of spinal motion, offering a promising 3D alternative to conventional dynamic X-ray imaging for assessing spinal instability.",2026-02-13,physics.med-ph; cs.AI
2602.12902v1,Robustness of Object Detection of Autonomous Vehicles in Adverse Weather Conditions,Fox Pettersen; Hong Zhu,"As self-driving technology advances toward widespread adoption, determining safe operational thresholds across varying environmental conditions becomes critical for public safety. This paper proposes a method for evaluating the robustness of object detection ML models in autonomous vehicles under adverse weather conditions. It employs data augmentation operators to generate synthetic data that simulates different severance degrees of the adverse operation conditions at progressive intensity levels to find the lowest intensity of the adverse conditions at which the object detection model fails. The robustness of the object detection model is measured by the average first failure coefficients (AFFC) over the input images in the benchmark. The paper reports an experiment with four object detection models: YOLOv5s, YOLOv11s, Faster R-CNN, and Detectron2, utilising seven data augmentation operators that simulate weather conditions fog, rain, and snow, and lighting conditions of dark, bright, flaring, and shadow. The experiment data show that the method is feasible, effective, and efficient to evaluate and compare the robustness of object detection models in various adverse operation conditions. In particular, the Faster R-CNN model achieved the highest robustness with an overall average AFFC of 71.9% over all seven adverse conditions, while YOLO variants showed the AFFC values of 43%. The method is also applied to assess the impact of model training that targets adverse operation conditions using synthetic data on model robustness. It is observed that such training can improve robustness in adverse conditions but may suffer from diminishing returns and forgetting phenomena (i.e., decline in robustness) if overtrained.",2026-02-13,cs.CV; cs.AI; cs.LG; cs.SE

However, existing benchmarks for multimodal browsing remain limited in task complexity, evidence accessibility, and evaluation granularity, hindering comprehensive and reproducible assessments of deep search capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce BrowseComp-$V^3$, a novel benchmark consisting of 300 carefully curated and challenging questions spanning diverse domains. The benchmark emphasizes deep, multi-level, and cross-modal multi-hop reasoning, where critical evidence is interleaved across textual and visual modalities within and across web pages. All supporting evidence is strictly required to be publicly searchable, ensuring fairness and reproducibility. Beyond final-answer accuracy, we incorporate an expert-validated, subgoal-driven process evaluation mechanism that enables fine-grained analysis of intermediate reasoning behaviors and systematic characterization of capability boundaries. In addition, we propose OmniSeeker, a unified multimodal browsing agent framework integrating diverse web search and visual perception tools. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models achieve only 36% accuracy on our benchmark, revealing critical bottlenecks in multimodal information integration and fine-grained perception. Our results highlight a fundamental gap between current model capabilities and robust multimodal deep search in real-world settings.",2026-02-13,cs.AI
2602.12875v1,A Microservice-Based Platform for Sustainable and Intelligent SLO Fulfilment and Service Management,Juan Luis Herrera; Daniel Wang; Schahram Dustdar,"The Microservices Architecture (MSA) design pattern has become a staple for modern applications, allowing functionalities to be divided across fine-grained microservices, fostering reusability, distribution, and interoperability. As MSA-based applications are deployed to the Computing Continuum (CC), meeting their Service Level Objectives (SLOs) becomes a challenge. Trading off performance and sustainability SLOs is especially challenging. This challenge can be addressed with intelligent decision systems, able to reconfigure the services during runtime to meet the SLOs. However, developing these agents while adhering to the MSA pattern is complex, especially because CC providers, who have key know-how and information to fulfill these SLOs, must comply with the privacy requirements of application developers. This work presents the Carbon-Aware SLO and Control plAtform (CASCA), an open-source MSA-based platform that allows CC providers to reconfigure services and fulfill their SLOs while maintaining the privacy of developers. CASCA is architected to be highly reusable, distributable, and easy to use, extend, and modify. CASCA has been evaluated in a real CC testbed for a media streaming service, where decision systems implemented in Bash, Rust, and Python successfully reconfigured the service, unaffected by upholding privacy.",2026-02-13,cs.SE; cs.AI
2602.12873v1,Knowledge-Based Design Requirements for Generative Social Robots in Higher Education,Stephan Vonschallen; Dominique Oberle; Theresa Schmiedel; Friederike Eyssel,"Generative social robots (GSRs) powered by large language models enable adaptive, conversational tutoring but also introduce risks such as hallucina-tions, overreliance, and privacy violations. Existing frameworks for educa-tional technologies and responsible AI primarily define desired behaviors, yet they rarely specify the knowledge prerequisites that enable generative systems to express these behaviors reliably. To address this gap, we adopt a knowledge-based design perspective and investigate what information tutor-ing-oriented GSRs require to function responsibly and effectively in higher education. Based on twelve semi-structured interviews with university stu-dents and lecturers, we identify twelve design requirements across three knowledge types: self-knowledge (assertive, conscientious and friendly per-sonality with customizable role), user-knowledge (personalized information about student learning goals, learning progress, motivation type, emotional state and background), and context-knowledge (learning materials, educa-tional strategies, course-related information, and physical learning environ-ment). By identifying these knowledge requirements, this work provides a structured foundation for the design of tutoring GSRs and future evaluations, aligning generative system capabilities with pedagogical and ethical expecta-tions.",2026-02-13,cs.HC; cs.AI
2602.12869v1,X-VORTEX: Spatio-Temporal Contrastive Learning for Wake Vortex Trajectory Forecasting,Zhan Qu; Michael Färber,"Wake vortices are strong, coherent air turbulences created by aircraft, and they pose a major safety and capacity challenge for air traffic management. Tracking how vortices move, weaken, and dissipate over time from LiDAR measurements is still difficult because scans are sparse, vortex signatures fade as the flow breaks down under atmospheric turbulence and instabilities, and point-wise annotation is prohibitively expensive. Existing approaches largely treat each scan as an independent, fully supervised segmentation problem, which overlooks temporal structure and does not scale to the vast unlabeled archives collected in practice. We present X-VORTEX, a spatio-temporal contrastive learning framework grounded in Augmentation Overlap Theory that learns physics-aware representations from unlabeled LiDAR point cloud sequences. X-VORTEX addresses two core challenges: sensor sparsity and time-varying vortex dynamics. It constructs paired inputs from the same underlying flight event by combining a weakly perturbed sequence with a strongly augmented counterpart produced via temporal subsampling and spatial masking, encouraging the model to align representations across missing frames and partial observations. Architecturally, a time-distributed geometric encoder extracts per-scan features and a sequential aggregator models the evolving vortex state across variable-length sequences. We evaluate on a real-world dataset of over one million LiDAR scans. X-VORTEX achieves superior vortex center localization while using only 1% of the labeled data required by supervised baselines, and the learned representations support accurate trajectory forecasting.",2026-02-13,cs.LG; cs.AI; cs.CV

We observe that many state-of-the-art open-source web agents rely on long tool-call trajectories with cyclic reasoning loops and exploration of unproductive branches. To address this, we propose WebClipper, a framework that compresses web agent trajectories via graph-based pruning. Concretely, we model the agent's search process as a state graph and cast trajectory optimization as a minimum-necessary Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) mining problem, yielding pruned trajectories that preserve essential reasoning while eliminating redundant steps. Continued training on these refined trajectories enables the agent to evolve toward more efficient search patterns and reduces tool-call rounds by about 20% while improving accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce a new metric called F-AE Score to measure the model's overall performance in balancing accuracy and efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that WebClipper compresses tool-call rounds under excellent performance, providing practical insight into balancing effectiveness and efficiency in web agent design.",2026-02-13,cs.AI

Chimera introduces a principled framework that maps attention-oriented neural computations and symbolic constraints onto dataplane primitives, enabling trustworthy inference within the match-action pipeline. Chimera combines a kernelized, linearized attention approximation with a two-layer key-selection hierarchy and a cascade fusion mechanism that enforces hard symbolic guarantees while preserving neural expressivity. The design includes a hardware-aware mapping protocol and a two-timescale update scheme that together permit stable, line-rate operation under realistic dataplane budgets. The paper presents the Chimera architecture, a hardware mapping strategy, and empirical evidence showing that neuro-symbolic attention primitives can achieve high-fidelity inference within the resource envelope of commodity programmable switches.",2026-02-13,cs.NI; cs.AI; cs.CR; cs.LG
2602.12846v1,Amortized Reasoning Tree Search: Decoupling Proposal and Decision in Large Language Models,Zesheng Hong; Jiadong Yu; Hui Pan,"Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has established itself as the dominant paradigm for instilling rigorous reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models. While effective at amplifying dominant behaviors, we identify a critical pathology in this alignment process: the systematic suppression of valid but rare (low-likelihood under the base model distribution) reasoning paths. We theoretically characterize this phenomenon as a ""Normalization Squeeze,"" where the interplay between mode-seeking policy gradients and finite sampling acts as a high-pass likelihood filter, driving the probability of rare correct traces to statistical extinction. To counteract this collapse without discarding the base model's latent diversity, we propose Amortized Reasoning Tree Search (ARTS). Unlike standard approaches that force internalization via parameter updates, ARTS prioritizes deliberation by decoupling generation from verification. We introduce a Flow Matching objective that repurposes the verifier to estimate the conservation of probability flow, enabling robust navigation through sparse, high-entropy search spaces where traditional discriminative objectives fail. Extensive experiments on the MATH-500 benchmark demonstrate that ARTS achieves a performance of 74.6% (BoN@16), effectively matching fully fine-tuned policies (74.7%) without modifying the generative backbone. Crucially, on the long-tail subset where coupled RL optimization collapses to 0% pass@k, ARTS uniquely recovers significant performance, suggesting that disentangling verification from generation offers a more robust pathway for solving complex reasoning tasks.",2026-02-13,cs.LG; cs.AI
2602.12833v1,TRACE: Temporal Reasoning via Agentic Context Evolution for Streaming Electronic Health Records (EHRs),Zhan Qu; Michael Färber,"Large Language Models (LLMs) encode extensive medical knowledge but struggle to apply it reliably to longitudinal patient trajectories, where evolving clinical states, irregular timing, and heterogeneous events degrade performance over time. Existing adaptation strategies rely on fine-tuning or retrieval-based augmentation, which introduce computational overhead, privacy constraints, or instability under long contexts. We introduce TRACE (Temporal Reasoning via Agentic Context Evolution), a framework that enables temporal clinical reasoning with frozen LLMs by explicitly structuring and maintaining context rather than extending context windows or updating parameters. TRACE operates over a dual-memory architecture consisting of a static Global Protocol encoding institutional clinical rules and a dynamic Individual Protocol tracking patient-specific state. Four agentic components, Router, Reasoner, Auditor, and Steward, coordinate over this structured memory to support temporal inference and state evolution. The framework maintains bounded inference cost via structured state compression and selectively audits safety-critical clinical decisions. Evaluated on longitudinal clinical event streams from MIMIC-IV, TRACE significantly improves next-event prediction accuracy, protocol adherence, and clinical safety over long-context and retrieval-augmented baselines, while producing interpretable and auditable reasoning traces.",2026-02-13,cs.LG; cs.AI; cs.MA
2602.12829v1,FLAC: Maximum Entropy RL via Kinetic Energy Regularized Bridge Matching,Lei Lv; Yunfei Li; Yu Luo; Fuchun Sun; Xiao Ma,"Iterative generative policies, such as diffusion models and flow matching, offer superior expressivity for continuous control but complicate Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning because their action log-densities are not directly accessible. To address this, we propose Field Least-Energy Actor-Critic (FLAC), a likelihood-free framework that regulates policy stochasticity by penalizing the kinetic energy of the velocity field. Our key insight is to formulate policy optimization as a Generalized Schrödinger Bridge (GSB) problem relative to a high-entropy reference process (e.g., uniform). Under this view, the maximum-entropy principle emerges naturally as staying close to a high-entropy reference while optimizing return, without requiring explicit action densities. In this framework, kinetic energy serves as a physically grounded proxy for divergence from the reference: minimizing path-space energy bounds the deviation of the induced terminal action distribution. Building on this view, we derive an energy-regularized policy iteration scheme and a practical off-policy algorithm that automatically tunes the kinetic energy via a Lagrangian dual mechanism. Empirically, FLAC achieves superior or comparable performance on high-dimensional benchmarks relative to strong baselines, while avoiding explicit density estimation.",2026-02-13,cs.LG; cs.AI
2602.12828v1,GRAIL: Geometry-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Inference with LLMs over Hyperbolic Representations of Patient Trajectories,Zhan Qu; Michael Färber,"Predicting future clinical events from longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) is challenging due to sparse multi-type clinical events, hierarchical medical vocabularies, and the tendency of large language models (LLMs) to hallucinate when reasoning over long structured histories. We study next-visit event prediction, which aims to forecast a patient's upcoming clinical events based on prior visits. We propose GRAIL, a framework that models longitudinal EHRs using structured geometric representations and structure-aware retrieval. GRAIL constructs a unified clinical graph by combining deterministic coding-system hierarchies with data-driven temporal associations across event types, embeds this graph in hyperbolic space, and summarizes each visit as a probabilistic Central Event that denoises sparse observations. At inference time, GRAIL retrieves a structured set of clinically plausible future events aligned with hierarchical and temporal progression, and optionally refines their ranking using an LLM as a constrained inference-time reranker. Experiments on MIMIC-IV show that GRAIL consistently improves multi-type next-visit prediction and yields more hierarchy-consistent forecasts.",2026-02-13,cs.LG; cs.AI

However, existing evaluation datasets are often limited to simple queries under constrained noise conditions, making them inadequate for assessing the robustness of spoken query retrieval systems under complex acoustic perturbations. To address this limitation, we present SQuTR, a robustness benchmark for spoken query retrieval that includes a large-scale dataset and a unified evaluation protocol. SQuTR aggregates 37,317 unique queries from six commonly used English and Chinese text retrieval datasets, spanning multiple domains and diverse query types. We synthesize speech using voice profiles from 200 real speakers and mix 17 categories of real-world environmental noise under controlled SNR levels, enabling reproducible robustness evaluation from quiet to highly noisy conditions. Under the unified protocol, we conduct large-scale evaluations on representative cascaded and end-to-end retrieval systems. Experimental results show that retrieval performance decreases as noise increases, with substantially different drops across systems. Even large-scale retrieval models struggle under extreme noise, indicating that robustness remains a critical bottleneck. Overall, SQuTR provides a reproducible testbed for benchmarking and diagnostic analysis, and facilitates future research on robustness in spoken query to text retrieval.",2026-02-13,cs.IR; cs.AI

One such domain is comedy, whereby both the general public working with ChatGPT and research-based LLM-systems have tried their hands on making humor. In formative interviews with professional comedians and video analyses of stand-up comedy in humans, we found that human performers often use their ethnic, gender, community, and demographic-based identity to enable joke-making. This suggests whether the identity of AI itself can empower AI humor generation for human audiences. We designed a machine-identity-based agent that uses its own status as AI to tell jokes in online performance format. Studies with human audiences (N=32) showed that machine-identity-based agents were seen as funnier than baseline-GPT agent. This work suggests the design of human-AI integrated systems that explicitly utilize AI as its own unique identity apart from humans.",2026-02-13,cs.HC; cs.AI

Ivanova,"Language models (LMs) are known to be prone to response biases, which present as option preference biases in fixed-response questions. It is therefore imperative to develop low-cost and effective response bias correction methods to improve LM performance and enable more accurate evaluations of model abilities. Here, we propose a simple response bias correction strategy ($\texttt{RBCorr}$) and test it on 12 open-weight language models using yes-no, entailment, and multiple choice questions. We show that response bias is prevalent in LMs pre-correction and that $\texttt{RBCorr}$ effectively eliminates bias and boosts model performance. We also explore the generalizability of bias behavior across models, datasets, and prompt formats, showing that LogProbs-based correction is highly dependent on all three of these aspects. Overall, $\texttt{RBCorr}$ is an easy-to-use method that can boost the performance of smaller LMs and ensure that LM performance on closed-response benchmarks aligns more closely with their true capabilities.",2026-02-12,cs.CL; cs.LG

However, existing benchmarks fail to differentiate question difficulty, limiting their ability to effectively distinguish models' capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose RankLLM, a novel framework designed to quantify both question difficulty and model competency. RankLLM introduces difficulty as the primary criterion for differentiation, enabling a more fine-grained evaluation of LLM capabilities. RankLLM's core mechanism facilitates bidirectional score propagation between models and questions. The core intuition of RankLLM is that a model earns a competency score when it correctly answers a question, while a question's difficulty score increases when it challenges a model. Using this framework, we evaluate 30 models on 35,550 questions across multiple domains. RankLLM achieves 90% agreement with human judgments and consistently outperforms strong baselines such as IRT. It also exhibits strong stability, fast convergence, and high computational efficiency, making it a practical solution for large-scale, difficulty-aware LLM evaluation.",2026-02-12,cs.CL; cs.AI
