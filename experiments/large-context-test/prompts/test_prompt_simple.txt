You have a CSV file at /home/peppi/Dev/nanobot/experiments/large-context-test/data/arxiv_papers.csv

This file contains ~88 ArXiv paper abstracts.

Your task:

1. Read the FIRST 20 ROWS of the CSV to understand the structure and see some data.

2. From those 20 rows, count how many papers each author has. List the top 3 authors.

3. For each of those 3 authors, spawn a SUBAGENT to search for mentions of "emergence" or "scaling" in their abstracts.

Spawn subagents IN PARALLEL.
