You have a CSV file at /home/peppi/Dev/nanobot/experiments/large-context-test/data/arxiv_papers.csv

This file contains ~500 ArXiv paper abstracts from cs.CL, cs.AI, and cs.LG categories.

Your task:

1. FIRST, explore the CSV to understand its structure. Read the first 20 rows to see the columns and format.

2. SECOND, identify the TOP 5 most-published authors in this dataset. Count how many papers each author has.

3. THIRD, for each of those 5 authors, spawn a SUBAGENT to:
   - Find all their papers in the dataset
   - Search for mentions of "emergent capabilities", "emergence", "scaling laws", or "phase transition" in their abstracts
   - Extract relevant quotes or summarize what they say about these topics
   - Return a structured summary

   IMPORTANT: Spawn all 5 subagents IN PARALLEL, not sequentially. Each subagent should only receive the relevant author's paper abstracts, not the entire dataset.

4. FOURTH, aggregate all subagent findings into a final summary that answers:
   - Which authors discuss emergence/scaling phenomena?
   - What are the key insights each author contributes?
   - Are there any disagreements or different perspectives?

Be efficient. Use parallel subagents. Report progress as you work.
