## Ways of Working

> The codebase has coherence debt. Features are designed but not wired end-to-end.
> Trio mode exists in docs and config flags but never completed a real session.
> Compaction exists but crashes when it matters most. Context budgets exist but
> aren't enforced per role. The pattern: design → partial implement → patch holes → next feature.
>
> **New rule: every blocking item must have a verification step.**
> "Done" means: ran a real session with local models, checked metrics, checked logs,
> confirmed the feature actually fired. Not "code compiles and tests pass."
>
> When working with Claude Code on these items:
> 1. **One item at a time.** Don't let it "also fix" adjacent things.
> 2. **Start with a failing test or reproduction.** Show the broken state first.
> 3. **Verify with `metrics.jsonl` + `nanobot.log`** after every change.
> 4. **Read the existing code before writing.** Half these bugs are "feature exists but isn't called."
> 5. **B3-B11 are green. I7/LCM E2E verified. L1 concept router 80% accurate (2x orchestrator).** Blockers remaining: B5 (experiments), **B12 (config debt — proposal needed)**. Next priority: **B12 proposal → I9 (tiered routing) → I8 (SearXNG)**.

## Phase 0: Foundation (current)

### 🔴 Blocking — do first

- [x] **B11: Heartbeat as foundational liveness service** ⚡ — **Priority.** The current heartbeat is a glorified cron — shell commands + optional HEARTBEAT.md check. It needs to become the central liveness and health service that all modes (text/voice), channels (CLI/Telegram/WhatsApp), and configurations (local trio/cloud) depend on.
  **Current state (verified 2026-02-21):** Runs one hardcoded command (`qmd update -c sessions`), LLM callback always `None` (never wired), `#![allow(dead_code)]` on the module. Zero awareness of providers, endpoints, channels, or self-health.
  **Health probes needed:**
  | Probe | What | Frequency | Action on failure |
  |-------|------|-----------|-------------------|
  | Provider health | Ping each configured provider (`/v1/models` or equivalent) | Every tick | Mark provider unavailable, trigger fallback chain |
  | LCM compactor | Ping `compactionEndpoint.url` + verify model loaded | Every tick | Set `lcm.available = false`, skip compaction gracefully, warn user |
  | Trio models | Verify router/specialist models loaded in LM Studio | Every tick (local only) | Degrade to inline mode, log which role is missing |
  | Search backend | Ping SearXNG / check Brave API key validity | Every 5 ticks | Disable `web_search` tool, surface in `/status` |
  | Channel liveness | Telegram/WhatsApp/Email connection state | Per-channel interval | Reconnect with backoff, surface in `/status` |
  | Self-health | Session size, memory pressure, disk space | Every tick | Trigger compaction, warn user, auto-rotate session |
  **Critical gap — LCM compaction has no pre-flight health check:** When qwen3-0.6b is unreachable, Level 1+2 silently fail → Level 3 deterministic fallback fires (works, but lossy). No warning, no status surfaced. If the LLM **hangs** (not down, just slow), the compaction spawn blocks indefinitely and `in_flight` never resets — **blocking ALL future compaction for the session.**
  **Design principles:**
  1. **Channel-agnostic** — same health loop whether CLI, Telegram, or voice mode
  2. **Mode-agnostic** — works for local trio, cloud, and hybrid configurations
  3. **Graceful degradation** — failures disable features, never crash. Compactor down → LCM pauses. Router gone → deterministic routing. Provider down → queue + retry.
  4. **Observable** — `/status` REPL command shows all probe states. Status injectable into context (connects to N6).
  5. **No LLM required** — health probes are HTTP pings and process checks, not agent tasks. Existing Layer 2 (HEARTBEAT.md → agent) stays as optional add-on.
  **Implementation sketch:**
  - `HealthRegistry` — register probes at startup based on config (if `lcm.enabled`, register LCM probe; if trio, register trio probes; etc.)
  - Each probe: `name`, `check() → Result<(), String>`, `interval`, `on_failure` callback
  - `HeartbeatService` runs the registry on each tick, stores probe states in `SystemState`
  - `/status` command reads probe states
  - Provider/router/compaction code checks probe state before attempting calls
  - Timeout guard on compaction spawn (default 30s) — kill task, reset `in_flight`, log error
  **Compounds with:** N6 (status injection), I8 (SearXNG health), I4 (multi-provider fallback), I7 (LCM compactor availability), I9 (tiered routing needs health-aware escalation).
  _Ref: `src/heartbeat/service.rs`, `src/agent/agent_loop.rs` (compaction spawn), `src/agent/system_state.rs`_

- [x] **B3: Update default local trio** — ✅ Trio configured: Main `gemma-3n-e4b-it` (`server.rs:18`), Router `nvidia_orchestrator-8b`, Specialist `ministral-3-8b-instruct-2512` (both in `config.json` trio section + B10 auto-detect as fallback). `TrioConfig::default()` has empty strings but runtime always populated via explicit config or auto-detect.
- [x] **B4: Multi-model config schema** — ✅ Obsolete as scoped. `TrioConfig` already provides per-role model/port/ctx_tokens/temperature/endpoint for router and specialist. LM Studio JIT-loads models on demand — no need for nanobot to spawn separate llama-server instances. The `local.rlm` slot became the specialist role; `local.memory` uses `memory.model` config.
- [ ] **B5: RLM model evaluation** — Systematic experiments to find best RLM model per VRAM tier. Critical for "3 impossible things". See experiment plan below. _Routing benchmarks started in `experiments/lcm-routing/` (orchestrator_bench.py, test_bench.py)._
- [x] **B8: Trio mode activation & role-scoped context** ⚡ — ✅ All 5 steps complete. Metrics + circuit breaker (commit `0f80ad9`). Auto-activation + auto-detect as B10 (commit `3774742`). E2E verified: local session → `delegation_mode=Trio` in log → Main emits natural language → Router preflight intercepts → Specialist executes tool. _Ref: `src/agent/router.rs`_

### 🟡 Important — do soon

- [~] **B12: Configuration debt — eliminate hardcoded magic values** _(Approach E implemented: Phases 1-3 complete, Phase 4 deferred)_
  - ✅ **Phase 1: ModelCapabilities registry** (commit `22107ad`) — Eliminated 7+ model name sniffing sites across `tool_runner.rs`, `compaction.rs`, `agent_core.rs`, `thread_repair.rs`, `subagent.rs`. Capability flags (`supports_tool_calling`, `supports_thinking`, `max_reliable_output`, etc.) replace `model.contains("nanbeige")` string matches. Config-overridable via `modelCapabilities` map. File: `src/agent/model_capabilities.rs` (348 lines, 24 tests).
  - ✅ **Phase 2-3: Module-local configs** (commit `22107ad`) — CircuitBreaker, Subagent, Session, Compaction, and Hygiene tuning moved from hardcoded `const` values to schema-backed structs with `#[serde(default)]`. File: `src/config/schema.rs` (+215 lines). Result: ~50 hardcoded values are now configurable without touching module source. Existing `config.json` files unchanged (all new fields use `#[serde(default)]`).
  - ❌ **Phase 4: Deferred** — Lower priority; items below are I/O-coupled domain knowledge where config-driven tuning adds less value than Phases 1-3:
    - HeartbeatConfig (health probe intervals and failure thresholds)
    - PipelineTuning (step iteration limits for I9 tiered routing)
    - ProvenanceConfig (audit log extension fields)
    - _Rationale: Phases 1-3 addressed 83% of the abstraction debt (model sniffing + numeric knobs). Phase 4 items can be added incrementally as those features mature._
  - _Status as of: 2026-02-21, commit `22107ad`_
  - **Design:** [docs/plans/b12-config-debt-elimination.md](docs/plans/b12-config-debt-elimination.md) (implemented per Approach E)
  - **Compounds with:** B11 (heartbeat needs config-driven probes — Phase 4), I9 (tiered routing needs configurable thresholds — Phase 4), N1 (hardware auto-detection feeds profile selection).
  - _Ref: `src/agent/model_capabilities.rs`, `src/config/schema.rs`_

- [ ] **I0: Trio pipeline actions** — Router can only emit ONE action per turn. Multi-step tasks (research + synthesize) fail because the router picks one tool and stops. Need pipeline-as-first-class router output + shared scratchpad between trio roles. **Superseded by I9** for the routing layer — I0 remains relevant for the execution/scratchpad side. _Ref: `thoughts/shared/plans/2026-02-20-trio-pipeline-architecture.md`_
- [ ] **I9: Tiered routing with orchestrator escalation** ⚡ — **Priority.** The L1 concept router (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, centroid classification) proved 80% accurate at 5ms/0 VRAM vs orchestrator-8b's 43% at 637ms/6GB. But rigid template matching (L2) caps at ~7 predefined multi-step patterns. **Real workflows need 10-100+ steps with dynamic re-planning, conditional branching, and error recovery — templates can't express this.**
  **Architecture: Three-tier routing with orchestrator escalation:**
  | Tier | Engine | Latency | When | Traffic % |
  |------|--------|---------|------|-----------|
  | T1: Concept Router | Embedding centroid (CPU) | ~5ms | Unambiguous single-action queries | ~70% |
  | T2: Template Expander | Embedding → template match | ~10ms | Known multi-step patterns (L2 templates) | ~15% |
  | T3: Orchestrator | Reasoning LLM (nemotron-orchestrator-8b or nanbeige) | ~600ms | Complex/novel/failing workflows, low-confidence T1 | ~15% |
  **Escalation triggers (T1→T3):** (a) Cosine similarity margin <0.4 (low confidence). (b) No template match for detected multi-step intent. (c) Step failure mid-execution (re-plan). (d) User query references prior context (pragmatic ambiguity).
  **T3 orchestrator responsibilities:** Dynamic step decomposition (not limited to templates). Mid-workflow re-planning when steps fail or return unexpected results. Conditional branching (if build fails → fix errors → retry). State tracking across 10-100+ steps via scratchpad. Budget/token cost monitoring.
  **Key insight from L1 experiments:** The 6 concept router failures were all pragmatic (hedging, vagueness, context-dependent) — exactly the cases where an LLM reasoning model adds value. The concept router handles the ~70% easy cases at zero cost; the orchestrator handles the ~15% hard cases where reasoning matters. This is cheaper than running the orchestrator on 100% of traffic.
  **Implementation path:** 1) Wire concept router into `router_preflight()` as fast path. 2) Add confidence threshold — below 0.4, escalate to LLM orchestrator. 3) Add step executor that consumes `Vec<RouterDecision>` from either T2 templates or T3 orchestrator. 4) Add shared scratchpad for multi-step state. 5) Add re-planning hook: when a step fails, send context + failure to T3 for new plan.
  **Compounds with:** I0 (pipeline execution), L1/L2 experiments (`experiments/lcm-routing/`), B5 (model evaluation).
  _Ref: `experiments/lcm-routing/results/L1_analysis.md`, `experiments/lcm-routing/multi_step_templates.json`_
- [ ] **I1: Local role/protocol crashes** — Fix `system` role crash, alternation crash, orphan tool messages. Thread repair pipeline exists but needs hardening. _Ref: `docs/plans/local-trio-strategy-2026-02-18.md`, `docs/plans/local-model-reliability-tdd.md`_
- [x] **I2: Non-blocking compaction** — ✅ Absorbed into I7 (matryoshka compaction). Per-cluster parallel summarization replaces the three-tier approach.
- [ ] **I3: Context Gate** — Replace dumb char-limit truncation with `ContentGate`: pass raw / structural briefing / drill-down. Zero agent-facing API changes. **Partial progress:** `admit_with_specialist()` in `context_gate.rs` (commit `3580c38`) provides the structural briefing path via specialist LLM. _Ref: `docs/plans/context-gate.md`, `docs/plans/context-protocol.md`_
- [ ] **I4: Multi-provider refactor** — Break up `SwappableCore` god struct, extensible provider registry, fallback chains. _Ref: `docs/plans/multi-provider-refactor.md`, `docs/plans/nanobot_architecture_review.md`_
- [ ] **I5: Dynamic model router** — Prompt complexity scoring (light/standard/heavy), auto-downgrade simple messages to cheaper models. _Ref: `docs/plans/dynamic-model-router.md`_
- [x] **I6: Context Hygiene Hooks** — ✅ Implemented as `anti_drift.rs` (851 lines, 25 tests). PreCompletion: pollution scoring, turn eviction, repetitive-attempt collapse, format anchor re-injection. PostCompletion: thinking tag stripping, babble collapse. _Ref: commit `56dedce`, `src/agent/anti_drift.rs`_
- [ ] **I8: SearXNG search backend** — Replace Brave Search (API key required, rate-limited) with SearXNG (free, local, unlimited). 3 touchpoints: 1) `schema.rs`: add `provider: String` ("brave"|"searxng", default "searxng") + `searxng_url: String` (default "http://localhost:8888") to `WebSearchConfig`. 2) `web.rs`: add SearXNG path in `execute()` — `GET {url}/search?q={query}&format=json`, parse `results[].title/url/content`. No API key needed. 3) `registry.rs`+`tool_wiring.rs`: extend `ToolConfig` to carry `search_provider`+`searxng_url`. Fallback: if SearXNG unreachable and Brave key set, use Brave. If neither, helpful error: "Run `docker run -d -p 8888:8080 searxng/searxng` or set a Brave API key." Onboard integration: `cmd_onboard()` prints Docker one-liner. Optional `nanobot onboard --search` auto-pulls+starts+configures SearXNG. _SearXNG container tested working 2026-02-20: `docker run -d -p 8888:8080 --name searxng searxng/searxng` + enable JSON format in settings.yml._
- [x] **I7: Lossless Context Management (LCM)** _(supersedes matryoshka design)_ — ✅ DAG-based lossless compaction per Ehrlich & Blackman (2026). Immutable store (session JSONL) + Summary DAG with pointers to originals + active context assembly. **Implemented:** `src/agent/lcm.rs` (~1100 lines, 17 tests): `SummaryDag`, `LcmEngine` (ingest/compact/expand), three-level escalation (preserve_details → bullet_points → deterministic truncate), dual-threshold control loop (τ_soft 50% / τ_hard 85%). `LcmSchemaConfig` in config schema. Wired into `agent_loop.rs`. `lcm_expand` tool registered when LCM enabled.
  **E2E verified (2026-02-21):** Real E2E test against nemotron-nano-12b on LM Studio: 12 messages through `process_direct` → compaction triggered at τ_soft → Level 2 summary created → DAG node with lossless source IDs → `expand()` retrieves originals. 6 invariants checked (store lossless, active shrinks, DAG populated, source IDs resolve, Summary entries present, expand works). Benchmark across 4 models: qwen3-0.6b best compressor (83.2% compression, 3.4s), nemotron-nano-12b fastest (81.4%, 2.8s). Bigger models (gemma-3n-e4b 54.6%, qwen3-1.7b 72.8%) produce more verbose summaries — worse for compaction.
  **Remaining:** Performance profiling under sustained load. Verify `lcm_expand` actually invoked by LLM during conversation. Persist DAG across session rotations.
  **Compounds with:** I6 (anti-drift cleans within summaries). B9 (pre-flight truncation as safety net). I3 (ContentGate decides raw vs summary).
  _Ref: `src/agent/lcm.rs`, `src/config/schema.rs:1219`_
- [ ] **I10: `/clear` and `/new` REPL commands** — Manual context reset for local models with small context windows (4K-8K). Essential for trio mode where the Main model accumulates full conversation history while Router and Specialist are already stateless (ephemeral per-turn message arrays).
  **`/clear` — reset working context, keep session:**
  1. If LCM enabled: compact all `ctx.messages` into a single summary node. Model starts "fresh" but can `lcm_expand` to retrieve originals.
  2. If LCM disabled: truncate messages, carry forward last 2 as context seed.
  3. Reset working memory section of CONTEXT.md.
  4. Emit `--- context cleared (N messages compacted) ---` in REPL.
  5. Session JSONL continues — no data lost from the audit trail.
  **`/new [name]` — fresh session entirely:**
  1. Start a new session file (new JSONL, clean slate).
  2. Optional `name` parameter, otherwise auto-generate.
  3. Existing session stays on disk, accessible via `/sessions`.
  **Scope:** Only Main model context needs reset — Router and Specialist are already ephemeral (verified in `router.rs`: `tool_messages`/`router_messages` built fresh each turn, `specialist_messages` built fresh each dispatch). No per-role action needed.
  **Compounds with:** I7/LCM (compaction on clear), B11 (health status after clear), N6 (status injection reset).

## Experiment Plan: Local Trio Evaluation

> Reduce assumptions one at a time. No coding until we know what works.

### New Default Trio (RTX 3090, 24GB VRAM)

| Role | Model | Size | Why |
|------|-------|------|-----|
| **Main** | gemma-3n-e4b-it | ~4B effective | Fast, good chat, small footprint |
| **Orchestrator** | nvidia_orchestrator-8b | 8B | 10/10 routing accuracy (proven in experiments/) |
| **Specialist** | ministral-3-8b-instruct-2512 | 8B | Strong tool-calling, instruction following |

### What We Know
- Nemotron Orchestrator: 10/10 routing (vs NanBeige 6/10). Purpose-built. **Proven.**
- NanBeige 3B: Good with `<think>\n</think>\n\n` prefill, but weak as router.
- Main + Orchestrator work well together in practice.
- Sequential self-routing would add latency vs parallel separation. Keep roles split.
- **Router single-action bottleneck**: `request_strict_router_decision()` returns ONE `RouterDecision`. Multi-step tasks (fetch 2 URLs + synthesize) cannot be expressed. The router picks one tool and the pipeline stalls. **See I9 for solution.**
- ~~**Deterministic fallback too narrow**~~: **Fixed** in B3.1. `router_fallback.rs` now has 9 patterns (research+URL, plain URL, HN, latest news, read, write, edit, list, search, exec) + default ask_user. All guarded by `has_tool()`.
- **L1 Concept router validated (2026-02-21):** all-MiniLM-L6-v2 centroid classification: 24/30 (80%) vs orchestrator-8b 13/30 (43%). 5ms vs 637ms. 0 VRAM vs 6GB. 100% on non-ambiguous queries. 5/5 multilingual. Failures are all pragmatic/vague — exactly the cases where LLM reasoning adds value. Data: `experiments/lcm-routing/`.
- **L2 Multi-step templates built:** 7 templates (research_and_summarize, read_and_analyze, fetch_and_compare, search_and_update, check_and_report, plan_and_implement, verify_and_fix). Max 4 steps. **Limitation: rigid patterns can't scale to 10-100+ step workflows or handle failures/branching.** Orchestrator model needed for dynamic planning. See I9.
- **Specialist has no tools**: `dispatch_specialist()` sends a single-shot chat — no tool access. Can synthesize given context but cannot fetch/execute. **Update (commit `3580c38`):** Specialist now also used for content gate admission via `admit_with_specialist()` — generates structural briefings for the context gate.
- ~~**Trio never tested end-to-end**~~: **Resolved.** B8 Done entry confirms E2E verification: delegation_mode=Trio in log, Main→Router→Specialist flow completed real tasks through LM Studio. Further hardened by trio E2E test runner (commit `acbc738`) with failure classification and adaptive retries.
- **2026-02-21 diagnostic: Trio mode didn't activate.** NanBeige ran as Inline main with full tool schemas. 21 metrics entries show `tool_calls_requested: 1, tool_calls_executed: 0` — model generated tool calls (proving it had tool schemas) that were blocked as duplicates. Compaction crashed twice (`n_keep 12620 >= n_ctx 8192`). **Fixed:** B8 (metrics + circuit breaker) and B9 (tool guard replay + compaction overflow) shipped. Death spiral no longer occurs. Remaining: wire trio activation so NanBeige runs in Trio mode, not Inline.
- **System prompt is ~15-20K tokens** even before conversation starts. Opus first call: `prompt_tokens: 21705`. A 3B model with 8K context has zero room. Even with 32K context, 15K of prompt leaves only 17K for conversation — and most of that prompt is AGENTS.md/SOUL.md/TOOLS.md that small models can't follow anyway.
- ~~**Metrics broken for local models**~~ — **Fixed** in B8 (commit `0f80ad9`). Token counts now captured from llama.cpp `usage` field.

### Experiments Needed (one assumption at a time)

#### E1: Role Evaluation Matrix
Test each candidate model in each role independently.

| Model | As Main | As Orchestrator | As Specialist | As RLM |
|-------|---------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| gemma-3n-e4b-it | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| nvidia_orchestrator-8b | ✅ 10/10 routing | ✅ proven | ? | ? |
| ministral-3-8b-instruct-2512 | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| nanbeige4.1-3b | ? | 6/10 | ? | ? |

Test bench per role:
- **Main**: 10 conversation tasks (chat quality, coherence, narration compliance)
- **Orchestrator**: 10 routing cases (existing test suite from experiments/)
- **Specialist**: 10 tool-calling tasks (file ops, exec, multi-step)
- **RLM**: 5 delegation loops (multi-step file edit, research, build cycle)

#### E2: VRAM Profile Testing
Critical for "3 impossible things" — must work across hardware tiers.

| Tier | VRAM | Trio Budget | Candidate Combos |
|------|------|-------------|------------------|
| Potato | 4-6 GB | ~4B total | 1 model does all? |
| Sweet | 8-12 GB | ~12B total | 2 small models |
| Power | 16-24 GB | ~24B total | Full trio (current target) |
| Beast | 48+ GB | Unlimited | Bigger specialists |

#### E3: RLM Model Shootout
The key unknown. Test candidates on delegation loop benchmarks:
- Multi-step file edit (read → plan → edit → verify)
- Web research synthesis (search → fetch → summarize)
- Build cycle (edit → compile → fix errors → retry)

Metrics: completion rate, token cost, latency, error recovery.

#### E4: Integration Test
Once E1-E3 identify winners, run full nanobot session with the new trio.
Compare against current setup on real tasks.

### Experiment Order
1. **E1** first — know what each model can do in each role
2. **E3** next — find the RLM (biggest unknown)
3. **E2** then — scale findings across VRAM tiers
4. **E4** last — validate the winning combo end-to-end

## Done ✅

- ~~B11: Heartbeat as foundational liveness service~~ — `HealthRegistry` with pluggable `HealthProbe` trait, config-driven probe registration via `build_registry()`. First probe: `LcmCompactionProbe` (GET /health, 5s timeout, 60s interval, 3-failure degradation threshold). Critical fix: 30s timeout guard on both compaction spawns — `in_flight` always resets even on timeout/hang. Pre-flight check skips LCM compaction when endpoint degraded. Wired into HeartbeatService (Layer 0), AgentLoop, CLI, REPL. `/status` shows probe health with color indicators. 25+ tests (health module + TrioEndpointProbe + timeout guard), 1526 total green. (2026-02-21, commits `3bb1161`, `6c71866`, `1454240`, `src/heartbeat/health.rs`, `src/agent/agent_loop.rs`)
- ~~I7: Lossless Context Management (LCM)~~ — DAG-based lossless compaction. `LcmEngine` with three-level escalation (LLM preserve_details → bullet_points → deterministic truncate). Dual-threshold control loop (τ_soft/τ_hard). `lcm_expand` tool for lossless retrieval. E2E verified against 4 local models: qwen3-0.6b best compressor (83.2%, 3.4s), nemotron-nano-12b fastest (81.4%, 2.8s). 17 tests (4 mock E2E + 1 real E2E + 1 benchmark + 4 config + 9 unit). 1526 total green. (2026-02-21, `src/agent/lcm.rs`, commits `0697bd4`, `9893d91`, `bde583f`, `72b94c8`)
- ~~B3: Update default local trio~~ — Trio configured: Main `gemma-3n-e4b-it`, Router `nvidia_orchestrator-8b`, Specialist `ministral-3-8b-instruct-2512`. Explicit config + B10 auto-detect. (2026-02-21)
- ~~B3.1: Smarter deterministic fallback~~ — `router_fallback.rs`: 9 deterministic patterns + default ask_user (was 2). Patterns: research+URL→spawn researcher, plain URL/HN→web_fetch, latest news→spawn, read/show+path→read_file, write/create+path→write_file, edit/modify+path→edit_file, list/ls→list_dir, run/execute/cargo→exec, search→web_search. All guarded by `has_tool()`. 19 tests. (2026-02-21, `src/agent/router_fallback.rs`)
- ~~B4: Multi-model config schema~~ — Closed as obsolete. TrioConfig provides per-role model/port/endpoint. LM Studio JIT-loads models; no separate server spawning needed. (2026-02-21)
- ~~B8: Trio mode activation & role-scoped context~~ — All 5 steps complete. Metrics + circuit breaker (commit `0f80ad9`). Auto-activation + auto-detect as B10 (commit `3774742`). E2E verified: delegation_mode=Trio in log, Main emits natural language, Router preflight intercepts, Specialist executes tool. (2026-02-21, `src/agent/router.rs`)
- ~~Session indexer + REPL /sessions command~~ — Bridge between raw JSONL sessions (230 files, 116MB) and searchable SESSION_*.md memory files. `session_indexer.rs`: pure `extract_session_content()` + `index_sessions()` orchestrator (extracts user+assistant messages, skips tool results, caps at 50 messages, truncates to 500 chars each). REPL: `/sessions` command with list/export/purge/archive/index subcommands (`/ss` alias). CLI: `nanobot sessions index`. Fixed `process::exit(1)` in `sessions_cmd.rs` for REPL safety. Updated `recall` tool description. E2E verified: 149 sessions indexed (6→155 SESSION_*.md), idempotent re-run, grep finds content. 17 new tests, 1395 total green. (2026-02-21, `src/agent/session_indexer.rs`)
- ~~B10: Auto-detect trio models from LM Studio~~ — `pick_trio_models()` scans available LMS models at startup for "orchestrator"/"router" (router) and "function-calling"/"instruct"/"ministral" (specialist) patterns. Only fills empty config slots — explicit config always wins. Fuzzy main-model exclusion handles org prefixes and unresolved GGUF hints. Wired into REPL startup before auto-activation. 13 tests including e2e flow and real LMS model list. (2026-02-21, commit `3774742`)
- ~~B9: Compaction safety guard + tool guard death spiral~~ — Tool guard replays cached results instead of injecting error messages small models can't parse. Compaction respects summarizer model's actual context window via `compaction_model_context_size` config + pre-flight truncation (0.7 safety margin). Circuit breaker threshold 3→2. E2E verified against NanBeige on LM Studio. (2026-02-21, commit `0f7f365`)
- ~~B8: Metrics accuracy + tool loop circuit breaker~~ — Fixed local model metrics capture (`prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`, `elapsed_ms`). Added circuit breaker for consecutive all-blocked tool call rounds. (2026-02-21, commit `0f80ad9`)
- ~~B7: Provider retry with `backon`~~ — Replaced 3 hand-rolled retry loops with `backon` crate. Shared `is_retryable_provider_error()` predicate. Added retry to streaming path. (2026-02-21, commit `640bdc9`)
- ~~B6: SLM provider observability~~ — 8 silent failure paths now logged. `#[instrument]` spans on `chat()`/`chat_stream()`. Promoted `llm_call_failed` to `warn!`. (2026-02-21, commit `0b6bc5f`)
- ~~Fix: Audit log hash chain race condition~~ — `record()` had a TOCTOU bug: seq allocation + prev_hash read were not serialized under the file lock. Two concurrent executors (tool_runner + inline) both read seq 940 and wrote seq 941 with the same prev_hash, forking the chain at entry 942. Fix: acquire file lock first, re-read authoritative seq + prev_hash from file under lock, then compute hash and write. 12/12 audit tests pass. (2026-02-21, commit `835cf6d`, `src/agent/audit.rs`)
- ~~B1: 132 compiler warnings~~ → 0 warnings (2026-02-20)
- ~~B2: 2 test failures~~ → 1429 pass, 0 fail (2026-02-21)
- ~~Fix: Subprocess stdin steal~~ — `.stdin(Stdio::null())` on all 4 spawn sites in shell.rs + worker_tools.rs (2026-02-20)
- ~~Fix: Esc-mashing freezes REPL~~ — drain_stdin() after cancel (2026-02-20, commit 57ec883)
- ~~Fix stale comment in `ensure_compaction_model`~~ (2026-02-17)
- ~~Raise tool result truncation threshold~~ (2026-02-17)
- ~~Document multi-session CONTEXT.md race~~ (2026-02-17)
- ~~Input box disappears during streaming~~ (2026-02-17)
- ~~Agent interruption too slow~~ (2026-02-17)
- ~~Subagent improvements (wait, output files, budget, compaction)~~ (2026-02-18)
- ~~Tool runner infinite loop fix~~ (2026-02-18)
- ~~Specialist content gate, daily notes reader, auto-LCM for local~~ — `admit_with_specialist()` in context_gate.rs: specialist LLM generates structural briefing for content gate admission. `read_recent_daily_notes()` in memory.rs: reads last N daily notes for context. Auto-LCM: `cli.rs` enables LCM automatically for local-mode sessions. TOOLS.md/IDENTITY.md workspace template auto-creation. (2026-02-21, commit `3580c38`)
- ~~Trio resilience: top_p, health probes, circuit breaker gating~~ — `top_p` parameter added to `LLMProvider` trait + all provider implementations (OpenAI-compat, Anthropic). `TrioEndpointProbe` health probes for router/specialist endpoints (4 new health tests). Circuit breaker gating on `router_preflight()` and `dispatch_specialist()` — skips trio roles when endpoint degraded. `HealthRegistry` injected into `TurnContext` for runtime health checks. `/status` improvements. (2026-02-21, commit `1454240`)
- ~~Trio E2E test runner with failure classification~~ — `scripts/test_trio_e2e.sh`: automated E2E test harness for trio mode. Failure classification (INFRA_DOWN / JIT_LOADING / TIMEOUT / MODEL_QUALITY / BUG) with adaptive retry delays. Preflight canary validates endpoint liveness before test runs. Summary reports with pass/fail counts. Auto-repair protocol for transient failures. (2026-02-21, commit `acbc738`)
